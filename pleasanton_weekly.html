                    Thank you for the opportunity. I'm Joel Liu, I'm running for president city council District 3.
                    I'm an engineer, with a PHD in electrical engineering. I started to work in Pleasanton in 2008. Anda
                    few years later, our family choose to call Pleasanton home because of its safety and great
                    schools. I have always been passionate about volunteering and giving back to the community. I
                    currently serve as the chair of the committee on energy and the environment for our city and I'm
                    also a Tri-Valley representative at the community advisory committee at EBCE. I was a recently
                    honored to receive one of the eight volunteerism awards from my employer among 90,000 global
                    employees. As a father of two school age children, I care a lot about the safety and sustainability
                    My top priority is Public Safety. Support for our First Responders is essential, including our
                    alternate mental health program. I support the furthering environmental sustainability and the
                    collaboration with our partners, including the school district and Zone 7. As an engineering manager
                    I have led a multi-million dollar businesses and managed large budget. I will use my professional
                    experience to make certain the city stays on a fiscally sustainable path. As your council member, I
                    will work hard to enhance our small town atmosphere. To learn more about me please visit

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    Thank you to the Pleasanton Weekly for staging this forum. My name is Jeff Nibert, running for City
                    Council in District 1. The residents of Pleasanton deserve to have a Council member dedicated to
                    their best interests based on being a longtime contributing resident of Pleasanton. I've lived on my
                    street in Pleasanton for 35 years with my wife and raised three kids together, who all graduated
                    from Pleasanton schools. I now serve on the Planning Commission. The residents of Pleasanton deserve
                    a council member who has experience in managing multi-million-dollar budgets. As an engineer and
                    professional project manager at large companies my entire career, I have that experience. Most of
                    all, the residents of Pleasanton deserve a council member who has demonstrated a true volunteer
                    heart and dedication. As a longtime volunteer with youth, civic, church, and professional
                    organizations, I take to heart the public service values of being solution-centered, a great
                    teammate, respect for others, listening to concerns, and serving the citizens of Pleasanton. What I
                    will do is have a laser focus on the priorities of the citizens of Pleasanton and on solving the
                    challenges before us. There are many, and we will do it with gusto and pride and
                    "stick-to-it-tive-ness". What will I not do? I will not run for higher office. I will not accept
                    donations from builders and developers, because it is important to be independent when it comes to
                    considering building projects. I will not bring someone else's agenda to the city council. As a
                    planning commissioner and city council member, my only bosses are the residents of Pleasanton. Thank
                    you very much. Please visit my website at votejeffnibert.com.

                    Good evening, and thank you to the Pleasanton Weekly for hosting this forum. My name is Julie Testa
                    and I am seeking a second term in the newly created District 3. My first term, as city council
                    member was a historic one due to the pandemic and many ways that all levels of government had to
                    pivot in the face of safety and public health. Through the Challenges posed by covid-19, the
                    Pleasanton city council still advanced many important projects and programs. The rebuilt Fire
                    Station 3 which will be completed next month. The Downtown parking corridor will soon be completed
                    and add another 81 parking spaces to downtown, and through it all, Pleasanton emerged from the
                    global shutdown in a fiscally strong position. I'm very pleased that our city council, by an
                    unanimous vote passed an initiative that I championed: a pilot alternative response program. It
                    provides our stellar police Pleasanton Police Department with a new tool, two licensed mental health
                    clinicians to respond to designated calls for service. The program provides support to our officers
                    and is a win-win for everyone involved. Do you know that 94 percent of residents say Pleasanton is
                    an excellent or good place to live? In a second term as your Pleasanton city council member, I will
                    continue to prioritize residents interests over special interests, preserve Pleasanton's historic
                    downtown and small town character and excellent liveability, promote and support public safety
                    resources, promote clean, water conservation. And finally, I will push back on state-required,
                    excessive housing mandates. I have 30 years plus experience and commitment to advocating for
                    residents and businesses of Pleasanton. I have worked hard and I would appreciate your vote.

                    Thank you to the Pleasanton weekly for hosting us tonight. My name is Dean Wallace. And I'm running
                    to bring a forward-looking perspective to the Pleasanton city council, that of someone who's lived
                    in the Tri-Valley for over 20 years. I went to high school and graduated from high school here in
                    the Tri-Valley, and came back after college to live close to family. I understand firsthand the
                    challenges that are facing our young Working Families and young professionals. This is the first
                    year that Pleasanton is going to district-based elections and district One is full of some of
                    Pleasanton's most vibrant businesses and communities. It's home to Hacienda Business Park and
                    StoneRidge Mall. It's home to both our Bart stations and its home to many of our parks and Open
                    Spaces. District one is also the most generationally socioeconomically and ethnically diverse
                    District in our city. It's home to many of our immigrant families. I myself am an immigrant. I was
                    born in Dublin, Ireland and moved here with my father who is Irish and my mother who is Mexican and
                    I was very proud to become a citizen of this country in 2011 and I love the fact that my community
                    is so diverse. It is also the most generationally diverse District in Our city. It's home to many of
                    our most well-established single-family neighborhoods and also many of our largest apartment
                    communities in Pleasanton. in fact, 25% of Pleasanton is renters, I myself am a renter Who aspires
                    to be a homeowner someday. I bring with me over a decade of experience working for local elected
                    officials On many of the most important and pressing issues facing our community. And if elected I
                    pledged to work closely with our residents listening to them, and working to improve and maintain
                    our high quality of life, Preserve Public Safety, continue the strong partnership between our
                    schools and our city, promote economic vitality, and to preserve a fiscally responsible budget. And
                    I'd be honored to earn your vote to do that On the city council, my website is www.deanwallace.com.

                    can't think what it's called, but this is new for us. So thank you for for participating. I am Jamie
                    Yee, resident of council District 3, and you may remember me from my time serving as a trustee on
                    the Pleasanton Unified School District for 12 years from 2008 to 2020. I represented the school
                    district on the city's economic Vitality commission from 2013 to 2020. I'm currently a Member of the
                    Civic Arts commission and co-chair of the Tri-Valley chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander American
                    public affairs Association. We can all agree that housing, safe and healthy, drinking water and
                    Public Safety are our priorities but I also believe that protecting Pleasanton's quality of life,
                    supporting Public Safety efforts collaboration and partnership with the school district, maintaining
                    fiscal sustainability, and balancing modern city needs while safeguarding the character of Main
                    Street are Equally important. I'm uniquely qualified because of my previous board governance
                    experience in providing oversight of a public entity. I will ask the tough questions, engage in open
                    minded, civil transparent discussion, and consider the community's needs and desires before voting.
                    I've held many volunteer positions, including many PTA leadership roles that led to eight years on
                    the State Board. I was appointed to the California Department of education's Environmental literacy
                    task force and represented the school district as a try Valley ROP board member. In 2007 I was
                    recognized as the California State Assembly, woman of the year for my advocacy efforts for School
                    nurses and school health services. I'm a very a native whose parents moved to Pleasanton in 1969,
                    And I graduated from Foothill as a senior class president. professionally I'm employed by the
                    Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, and I bring that public health perspective. I'm looking
                    forward to tonight's questions and answers, and thank you again to the Pleasanton weekly for hosting
                    this event.

                    Housing is among the top concerns for voters headed into this city council election. in the face of
                    so many related factors such as increasing state mandates, more unhoused and under housed
                    individuals and town, water supply, and traffic impacts just to name just a few, what is your view
                    on the need for residential growth in Pleasanton and how should the council balance, if at all, new
                    affordable housing and new market rate housing in the city?

                    Well, thank you very much for the question. I truly appreciate it. We all agree That more affordable
                    housing is needed in Pleasanton. I support increased development of affordable housing in places
                    where it's appropriate and makes sense. The city has already been successful with affordable housing
                    and we will do more. as a planning Commissioner, we are planning for it right now. But there's a bad
                    bill that my opponents boss wrote that is at the governor's desk. it's called AB-2011. It will
                    expand the kind of thing that's happening on Harrison Street to retail and Commercial zones. AB 2011
                    strips away local expertise and standard processes. Developers will be able to just check off the
                    boxes and the city must give them a permit. No Planning Commission review, no city council review,
                    and no public engagement. not all cities are built the same or plan the same. These
                    one-size-fits-all laws will provide No, support from the state for infrastructure. We need our
                    retail and commercial zones. The businesses in them create jobs and provide revenues that the city
                    relies on to provide services and create amenities. by replacing commercial zones with residential
                    housing It creates critical local Revenue loss. with this bill there is no way for the city to
                    intervene to mitigate the economic loss. Retail and commercial zones are supposed to include our
                    current and hopeful future restaurant and small business owners. Ab 2011, undermines our housing
                    element that we are in the middle of creating. if developers can simply build in retail and
                    Commercial zones that are unsuitable for housing, why are we as a city doing all this planning work?
                    It'll be a mess. It's a bad bill. It was written by my opponents boss and the difference between us
                    could not be starker.

                    I'm very concerned. I share Jeff Nibert's candidate Nibert's concerns about the state overreach in
                    our community. We, in our last RHNA cycle, we actually built 370 affordable housing units. So
                    Pleasanton is doing their share. in fact, Pleasanton build a higher percentage of our affordable
                    housing than any other city in Alameda County percentage-wise, and yet everybody can achieve their,
                    their market rate. we built three hundred percent of our market rate housing. But even being the top
                    producer top percentage of our RHNA requirement we still didn't come close to meeting our affordable
                    housing goals. The state housing numbers are unrealistic. They've been proven to be false. There was
                    a State Legislative audit that proved that they're false and we must push back on the state. I think
                    working Toward our affordable housing goals is imperative and the state has to help us with the
                    funding because we've been set up to fail. They know, we do not have the 1.5 billion dollars in
                    subsidy that would be required to build our, our RHNA affordable housing requirements.

                    Thank you for the question. I want to start off by saying one thing, my boss, While, I am proud to
                    work for her, she is not on the ballot. I also want to say that when asked about what they think the
                    top issue that this city council must address in a recent survey done by the city of Pleasanton. The
                    number one thing that the people of Pleasanton said in that survey was something about the lack of
                    affordable housing options and the cost of housing here in Pleasanton. And in that same survey, the
                    amount of people who said that the cost of housing in Pleasanton was a serious or very serious
                    concern was 70% that same survey said that those who think that the cost of living and the lack of
                    affordable, housing options for our workers that was at 50%. Those who say, there's too much
                    development here in Pleasanton, that was only 29 percent. I think this city council needs to have
                    more of a focus on increasing affordable housing here in Pleasanton. I live in the Stoneridge Mall,
                    which is sorry. I live across from the Stoneridge Mall which is one of the top locations that this
                    city has identified in the housing element plan on which to build housing and so, I want to make
                    sure that it's done, right. And right, for me means three things. First, It means that we look
                    closely at the environmental impact report So, that whatever is done, there is done in a way that is
                    sustainable according to our traffic and infrastructure needs. Two, that we engage the residents of
                    District 1, in a way, that makes sure that they are supportive of whatever goes in there. And three,
                    it is done in a way that... [Note: moderator cuts Wallace off at this point due to time]
                    <br>
                    I just want to complete what I was saying earlier. The third thing that I think is very important
                    when it comes to approaching housing, especially in District 1, and the city, is making sure that we
                    have a balanced approach across the entire city. In a recent city council meeting, a sitting member
                    of the city council suggested increasing the number of housing units that go into the Stoneridge
                    Mall site. I don't think that's a right approach. I think we have to have a balanced approach in
                    which the entire city shares in the burden of housing so that no one district is meant or made to
                    take all the housing needs for our city. So if elected, primary focus of mine will be making sure
                    that we have a balanced and equitable approach to sharing the burden of housing across the city.

                    Yes. Housing is definitely an issue in our community and one of the things that I hear over and over
                    again, is I really hope that my kids can afford to move back here so I don't have to move away
                    somewhere to see grandchildren. I think it's really important for us to focus about that because
                    this community is the way that it is because of so many generations that have been able to live
                    here. it's really given our community that character that we all love so much, So I think the
                    council really needs to balance, what is required by the state at our desire to have more affordable
                    housing. And I really believe that if we have a functional Council that can work together, we can
                    figure out ways to make that happen. We do live under SB 35, that says that we have to retain local
                    control or the state will retain local control, but it does kind of penalize communities that are
                    blocking Building their housing so that developers get to streamline their process and not have to
                    go through the normal approval processes, which is a little bit problematic for us, so we need to
                    pay attention to that, so we don't have, So we're not losing our local control. Workforce housing is
                    something that I've been a huge advocate for, for many, many years. being on the school board, it
                    was painfully obvious to us that teachers could not live in our community, So, Workforce housing is
                    definitely something that this Council needs to look at. Thank you.

                    Thank you for the question. Housing is very critical issue in our city and we, we have seen the
                    Mandat from the state and we are required to build, almost 6,000 housing unit. And the city council
                    is, has a gone through the review of the housing unit and submitted the plan, as I understand, And
                    right now is under the EIR, environmental impact review, and for us, we need to continue to go this
                    route, we need to continue to plan, and we needed to advocate for local control. We cannot have a
                    sacramental to to do to develop a bill like sb 35 and too too get rid of our local controls. we can
                    not they have high-rise a five-story building without the parking. And also we need a housing for

                    So, I want to start out by saying, as all residents of Pleasanton feel, I really love the character
                    and charm of our downtown. I went on dates in high school in downtown Pleasanton And I used to study
                    and read at Tully's before it became Pete's. So, my affinity for downtown has been long-standing. I
                    think the city has some great programs in place that have been helping to support and Revitalize our
                    downtown: Weekends on Main, the parklet programs, all those things I am fully supported of. I think
                    there are areas that we can improve though. I think we can look into doing more for pedestrian, bike
                    safty downtown, and across the city. I think we could also look at doing more to solve the
                    never ending saga that is parking in downtown, so that no one has to constantly worry about whether
                    or not they can park in that Bank of America parking spot. But I also think that when it comes to
                    downtown, we need To look at revitalizing it in this way. I think we need to be promoting and
                    inviting more small businesses to do business in downtown Pleasanton. And I think, right now that
                    the council is a little bit over doing the micromanaging of our downtown. we have this active floor,
                    use policy in which there's a lot being done to measure where desks and tables and what sold in a
                    small business. I would like to see us pull back from that and instead fill those empty storefronts
                    in our downtown.

                    Well, I think that we need to do it with a balanced approach, but I do think we need to keep in mind
                    that for small businesses, which make up a lot of our business owners in in Pleasanton is that
                    they're faced with, you know, rising cost of goods and services and that makes it difficult for them
                    to stay competitive. We need to keep that in mind. We also need to keep in mind that it's very
                    difficult for our businesses to attract and retain a adequate Workforce. And small businesses are
                    also facing tax increases and Regulatory fees, state and local that are really difficult for our
                    small businesses. So we need to keep that in mind as we move forward and plan and balance things.
                    So, you know, if we wanted to make some new ordinance, you know about something environmental that
                    they had to do. You know, we really need to keep in mind that they already have a lot of these,
                    these stresses on them already. So I think we need to look at things, you know, in a all the way
                    around picture and not just you know, one side and just only environmental and it's got all work
                    together. But really we need to keep in mind what the small businesses are facing every day to stay
                    competitive and stay in business, because they're very, very much a part of our Vibrant Community
                    and definitely needed their part of what makes Pleasanton Pleasanton.

                    Pleasanton residents rely on it, for dining, for shopping for entertainment and for socializing. My

                    of downtown. Of course there are things that can be done to improve the experience downtown and we
                    should do it there a number of items and capital improvement projects that are on the books on the
                    drawing board, they should be done with regard to the actual ground floor use policy. I was on the
                    Planning Commission. I supported the recent ordinance establishing the actual ground floor use
                    policy to establish 100% use. The policy as it now stands does not require extensive measurements.
                    It got rid of the need for extensive measurements. It's to encourage foot traffic downtown. Thank

                    In this time of continued drought, the three city owned and operated wells, which provide about 20%
                    of the city's annual water supply, are in need of rehabilitation or replacement. In addition, the
                    water contains a presence of PFAS chemicals, Contaminants the state is currently developing
                    restrictions on. In June 2021, the city was ready to take on the implementation of PFAS treatments
                    and well repairs, but those plans were paused by the council just last week. Do you think the city
                    should perceive with the original plan? Or do you prefer one of the other options now on the table
                    or perhaps another idea of your own?

                    Thank you for that question. I think this is one of the most important questions that we're going to
                    face this election cycle. When it comes to PFAS or the forever chemicals that are seeping into our
                    water supply, there's a lot of uncertainty and anxiety understandably around this issue. You know,
                    as you mentioned, the state and federal governments are currently looking at the most recent
                    research on PFAS and coming up with new regulations and standards for what is an acceptable level of
                    PFAS in our drinking water. And as you said, the city recently put a pause on its plans and I think
                    that given all the uncertainties that currently exists around what an acceptable level is, what the
                    cost will be, what's currently in the water, I think that pause was a good thing. I think that we
                    have to, as a city, continue to work closely with our partners in the region and in the water space,
                    including Zone 7 and DSRSD. I support looking into all the possible solutions to this problem which
                    includes blending of water, greater treatment of water, or further, or looking for new supplies of
                    water. But I think the North Star in all of this and what I want to emphasize is that we must as a
                    city ensure that we have a safe reliable and sustainable supply of drinking water for the residents
                    in Pleasanton. Thank you.

                    I think the pause was a good idea only because my experience in making really tough decisions has to
                    do with making sure that you have enough data. And I feel we're at a place right now where there's
                    just not enough known about it and all the different options aren't really brought forward yet. And
                    I think that the city council needs to support the staff of the city to really prioritize and be
                    able to do the work that they need to do to come up with some recommendations and be able to do the
                    research and all of that takes staff time and we need to prioritize the water issue and and let some
                    other things, slides, that the staff has the adequate time to bring recommendations. But I think
                    that, you know, Zone 7 is our water authority, and we should be looking closer to them. I know
                    that in the past that wasn't always a great relationship between the city and zone seven, but I
                    think that it has to be. Zone Seven is our water authority. We need to have a good relationship
                    there and we really need to make sure that we're looking at data before we make any real decisions.
                    And I think that that is still to come, but the pause was a good idea.

                    Thank you for the question. We all want the safe water. As a councilmember getting safe water is my
                    top priority. In Pleasanton, the water issue is a little bit complicated. We have aging wells and we
                    have the drought, and we needed to work with our partners and to deal with the PFAS issue. For this
                    complicated issue there is an engineering part; there is also a business part. Engineering part is,
                    this is a new issue. What technology we needed to choose? Buisness part is, does it make business
                    sense? As a PhD in engineering and worked on water treatment project on the electrical side before,
                    I believe what I'm well qualified to understand that the technical part. And as a leader who has
                    managed the multi-million dollar projects and the business, I believe I'm qualified to understand
                    the business part also. I agree with the current Council. We should pause. We need to pause and the
                    think what to do. And there are many things for us to think and I'm qualified to help the council to
                    decide the best option for our resident to get the safe water. Thank you.

                    Thank you. As an engineer and a project management professional I have a perspective on this that
                    comes from managing many such large projects in the past. As a project manager, you need to consider
                    a number of things when managing a project. Cost is certainly one of them. Schedule, resources, and
                    the scope of the project. It's appropriate when planning for a project that when you scope things
                    out, when you are deciding what to do, you learn the risks and the response plans that you intend to
                    have for those risks, you plan out what you intend to do in the case of any of those risk
                    materializing. In this case, we had concerns that the staff identified as with regard to the cost of
                    the program: the capital cost as well as operation and maintenance costs. The concern about
                    resources that the new treatment and well rehab system would require in the future. Concerns about
                    regulations and future regulations that could impose additional requirements on the system. So I
                    support the decision of the council to take a pause right now and take a look at what the
                    alternatives are, the regional water quality supply alternatives. In the meantime, the treatment
                    option remains the plan of record. It's still a viable option and it's one that I would support if
                    it is indeed selected. I do have concerns about water quality reliability from Zone 7.

                    Well, I'm so glad that everyone agrees that we made a good decision. It was a hard decision though
                    because we do know that the acceptable levels will be different very soon and just because the
                    identified levels are different doesn't change the risk that is currently involved in the water that
                    has the PFAS. There should be no PFAS in our water. It's a man-made chemical. It doesn't, there
                    should be zero. And I think that the acceptable levels are going to continue to go down because
                    there really should be none. But there's an urgency because we shut down one well and we know that
                    with the change of levels we're almost certainly going to be shutting down the other wells. We do
                    have short-term options, and that would be to purchase water, more water, instead of just 80 percent
                    of our water from Zone 7 we will be purchasing more of it. So while I think the pause was necessary,
                    we should look at our options. There's also an urgency so I believe we're going to be talking about
                    this again, very soon. Thank you.

                    change in community policing and criminal justice. Specifically address your thoughts on the recent

                    This is a tough question to answer in just in the time we have. Let's see. I really feel that I'll
                    start with the Chiefs Oversight, I guess it's called the Citizen Advisory. I think it's a good idea
                    to have an Advisory board that the chief gets to have some residents meet with them on a regular
                    basis because I really, in my experience with people, they sometimes don't understand really the
                    role of the police department and what their job is of the individual officers. So, I think any
                    time, where community members can meet with the police chief and further understand their role why
                    they're doing things they're doing, it really helps the greater community to understand and embrace
                    their role and support their role. It's really, you know, I guess I got that question asked me "do I
                    believe that there should be an oversight Committee in addition to the Chiefs advisory," and I
                    really feel that might be a little bit too micromanaging. You need to be kind of an expert at some
                    things to be able to provide oversight. So I'm not really sure what that would look like and what
                    that would mean. I would need to really understand what is expected of that particular committee, if
                    it were to take place, but I do think that anytime community members can have a deeper understanding
                    of law enforcement's role it's a good idea.

                    Thank you for the question. Public safety is my number one priority in my platform. There are two
                    fold in this equation. Exhibit of military like equipment. I think we definitely should allow the
                    police officer to have the right to exhibit a military like equipment and we need a have them or to
                    educate the public to know that that is a safe haven and when they need it and that's the safe place
                    to go to. And at the second part of the question is about police oversight committee. I don't think
                    our Police Department need police oversight committee. Our city council is elected to represent the
                    constitute in Pleasanton, to represent the people and oversee the safety operation, which includes
                    police department. And, on top of that, our police officers are all professionals and who they are
                    following the policies and procedures the city council has a placed. I do not see the need of [an]
                    oversight committee. Thank you.

                    Thank you very much for the question. In regard to community policing, I am so proud of the efforts
                    that our police department and our police professionals have made in terms of getting out there
                    among the public and establishing relations to improve, not only the image, but to convey to people
                    the good work that is being done. In all that I have heard and understood about the police
                    department they act extremely professionally in many, many, if not almost all situations. In regard
                    to school resource officers, 75 percent of parents say that school resource officer are good thing.
                    I've talked to students in high schools themselves who welcome the school resource officers, and
                    that that type of community policing is very fine and good. I understand the concern about possible
                    glorifying of equipment that might look like military style equipment, but I want kids to know that
                    with our police department responding to emergencies that this is what help will look like. They
                    need to know that when responses materialize that these are the professionals and the good people
                    and they know what that will look like. The effectiveness of the Police Chief's Advisory Board is
                    something that I have heard very good things about. They've gone to monthly meetings now as I
                    understand it and it's good.

                    Okay. Does everyone know that crime is trending downward in Pleasanton, significantly? It went down
                    significantly during covid for obvious reasons, but it's still trending downward even as we rebound
                    from covid. So, the, you know, we're so fortunate to have such a great community and such a great
                    Police Department. The CAB is not oversight. Right now, the city council is oversight and I'm
                    appreciative of that because prior to about a year ago there was no oversight of our police
                    department, which I don't think is okay. Even a great department requires, should have oversight, so
                    I take it seriously. I think that the bill of AB 481 that required the city council to oversee
                    approving the military equipment is a significant and good responsibility, but I don't think the
                    city council should be the oversight. I do believe that we need a professional oversight body and it
                    should be an independent auditor. There are other cities that use independent auditor, and it gives
                    community members a place to turn when there's a concern.

                    Thank you for the question. Like the overwhelming majority of residents of Pleasanton, I think our
                    Police Department is doing an excellent job. If elected, I pledge to preserve funding for our Public
                    Safety and SROs. I think our city and police department is clearly in good hands, capable hands.
                    When I look to questions of whether or not there should be more oversight of anybody or in this
                    case, the police department, what I'd want to ask is there evidence of a need for it. As it stands
                    now, I don't think Pleasanton has that need for greater oversight. You look around at other cities
                    in the Bay Area, Antioch for example, a need is clearly come in the city of Antioch. And I want to
                    say that I'll be the first to call for more oversight or greater reporting should anything come up
                    that shows that there is a need. As it stands right now, I don't see that need. When it comes to the
                    community policing, something I'm very supportive of. I also support making sure that our police
                    department has all the tools and equipment they need in the training like bias training and
                    descalation techniques, and making sure that mental health crisies have the appropriate response.
                    Those are all things I think that our Police Department is doing a very good job of handling. And I
                    want to be as supportive as possible of our police department and our chief, if elected to the city
                    council, thank you.

                    I'm looking at the wrong thing. But I would like to point out that there was a survey that was done
                    last fall FM3 research, and the question to the residents was: "What do you think the most serious
                    issue facing residents of Pleasanton that you would like to see the government do something about?"
                    And crime was number one. And it was up, the perception of our residents, was up 10%. So there's
                    some imbalance here of crime is going down, but people are feeling like it's not. So I just wanted
                    to raise that as an issue that we need to look into a little bit more.

                    Crime is definitely down. I do have this, the most current statistics from our department. Property
                    crime is down significantly, not just since 2019, but pre-covid. But, you know, going back to 2017
                    our property crimes were significantly higher than they currently are, and they continue to trend
                    downwards. And violent crime, homicide, rape, robbery, fortunately, we don't have a lot of that.
                    Everything has trended down. There's a small increase in aggravated assault that is within the
                    margin of error. So, even that the overall statistics for violent crime in Pleasanton is a serious
                    downward trend.

                    One mixed-use development being applied for in District 3 encapsulates the conflicting priorities
                    between local control and state requirements. The five-story project on Harrison Street would have
                    46 affordable housing units while skirting around many key city development standards under recently
                    adopted Senate Bill 35. What are your thoughts on the project and location and why? Do you believe
                    there are ways the city could have received better outcomes than the current project terms provide?

                    Thank you for the question. I saw the [artist rendering picture of] the five-story building. It
                    almost [breaks my heart]. It is in my district. Imagine you are the next door neighbor. You have one
                    single family house and the next one is going to build a 5-story housing and there is no parking.
                    How do you feel? That's what I feel. I just don't think that project is sitting in the right place
                    in Pleasanton. We do need a housing for teachers, firefighters, and many other working families. But
                    the location of that housing is wrong and is mandated, kind of, by SB 35. I talked with our city
                    manager and it seems to me there are not much options. But we really needed to do is we needed to
                    have more local control. We cannot have a Sacramento to let us to take all our control away. Our
                    city is well planned, planned for generations. And we cannot have this kind of housing and we need
                    to work with our legislators and the voice out and work with them to get a solution. Thank you.

                    Thank you very much for the question. You know, working as a planning commissioner, I see our
                    hard-working staff in the planning department in the community development department. They do so
                    much work, so much good work for the city, often behind the scenes, and they rarely get recognized.
                    They are very capable of doing the work to implement standard processes and to make sure that permit
                    conditions are complied with. The state has taken that local expertise away from Pleasanton. Our
                    expertise cannot be applied to things like the Harrison Street project. I spoke a little bit about
                    this in the earlier answer to AB 2011. These are the type of bills that my opponent's boss goes wild
                    over. Bill after bill after bill. Taking away local control. Stripping away local expertise. That
                    monstrosity at Harrison street should never be built. Of course, it probably will. All they have to
                    do is check the boxes at the planning department. They get their permit, they can go ahead and build
                    it. No worries about parking. No worries about towering over their neighbors. This is more
                    appropriate at another location. There are other places in Pleasanton where we could use that type
                    of housing. This is not it.

                    So absolutely, it's the wrong place. In another part of the community, in Hacienda a five story
                    would not be so devastating. This, you absolutely. If you haven't seen the artist renderings, it
                    towers over its closest property, which is a cute little one storey Bungalow. And there's two story
                    apartments across the street. And so if it was a two story or even a three-story it wouldn't be
                    offensive, but this five-story and zero parking in our already burdened parking burdened downtown. I
                    have been working to say we're going to work with our legislators. We've been doing that. We write
                    letters lots and lots of letters to the legislators. They're ignored. We need to do more. When SB 9
                    threatened, in fact, ended ended single-family zoning throughout the state, ended single-family
                    zoning throughout the state, your neighbor can now do a four-plex or 6 Plex under SB 9. 250 cities
                    came together and a letter was sent to the legislature and Governor saying "please don't do this"
                    and they did it anyway. The governor signed it the next day. We have to do more and I have been
                    working with a group Coalition of other electeds to do exactly that. We have alternatives. We have
                    things we can do to fight back, but our city has to fight back.

                    Thank you for the question. I want to start off by saying that I've also seen the renderings of the
                    site and plan project on Harrison Street. I want to say that if I had a decision to make over
                    whether or not I think that fits there I would say no. But I do want to lay out a few things about
                    about prop 35 -- SB 35, which is the bill we're talking about here. SB 35 was signed into law by
                    Governor Jerry Brown in 2017. That's five years ago. So, to answer the second part of your question,
                    the city now has had five years to take the steps needed so that a project like Harrison Street
                    wouldn't happen in the first place. In SB35, there is a provision that says, if City meets there.

                    I won't repeat a lot of what Candidate Wallace has said because I agree with a lot of it, but SB 35,
                    that we're living under right now, penalizes the cities who didn't really do their job. You know we
                    had the five years to come up with the numbers and the plan and that didn't happen, so the city
                    actually gave up its local control. They had it and they could have had it, but they gave it up
                    because they didn't have the right numbers. And so then now we're hit with streamlining. And it
                    really is properties that are near, I think, a half a mile within public transportation. I think
                    that if our city wanted to do anything to amend this bill, it would be getting a provision, maybe,
                    that public transportation had to be ongoing. It's right next to the ACE Train which doesn't really
                    run all the time except just for commuters. So if you were living there without a car, how would you
                    get to where you needed to go if it was non commute times. So to me, that's the part that seems a
                    little bit silly and that would be the change that I would like to look into. But I think that our
                    our city council over the past five years gave up the local control and it is really unfortunate. I
                    live near the downtown and I really don't want to see it. But I do question if anybody will rent it,
                    given that there is no parking. So remains to be seen. Thank you.

                    Okay, the city is one of four hundred and eighty cities in the state of California. I already said
                    earlier, we built, Pleasanton built 370 affordable units in our last cycle. We were better,
                    percentage-wise, of achieving our lowest affordability, better than any other city in Alameda County
                    percentage-wise. And I can support that with the housing, the state's own numbers. Only 29 cities
                    out of the entire state, 480, actually were able to meet their affordable housing goals, only 29
                    across the state. And those were cities that were so small that they had tiny, tiny little numbers.
                    We did not. We have been set up to fail. All cities are being set up to fail with these mandates
                    because they want the ministerial and the streamlining so we give the keys to the city to our
                    developers.

                    affordable housing goals, more than most cities in the state, because she's using percentage as a
                    way of measuring that. When it comes to building affordable housing in this city, the city has
                    failed. And it has failed according to the residents of Pleasanton, because building more affordable
                    housing for our residents is the top concern when the city of Pleasanton asked our residents what
                    were their top concerns. And the cost of affordable housing, even just affordable, is insanely high.
                    I pay 2500 dollars a month right now to rent a one-bedroom in this city. The city has failed to
                    build affordable housing and to just point to a percentage of a small number of units that's not
                    saying much of anything.

                    Thank you very much for the question. I really appreciate it. You're correct. The Stoneridge Mall
                    framework will significantly affect the area in which I live in, District 1. This, the new
                    Stoneridge Mall offers a chance to reimagine a whole new community, to reimagine the whole area, not
                    only with the mall, but around the mall. It's an opportunity for our city and our residents to come
                    together and decide what we want to see, what we want to envision, what we want to build there. The
                    vision that I have is of a regional attraction that can exemplify open space, can emphasize
                    high-quality housing, that offers a great opportunity for green grass, for walkability, for
                    sustainability. If you look at some of the other developments that our city consultants referred to
                    in the city council meeting the last time, the examples given are beautiful examples, are beautiful
                    developments that I think we can be proud of as a city. Upscale development. Outdoor restaurants
                    could be a very beautiful amenity. We must be careful that we don't piecemeal a solution for the
                    Stoneridge area framework. It needs to be a comprehensive plan that takes into account all of the
                    stakeholders that live there and adjacent. The environmental impacts and other impacts must be
                    studied well and must be addressed. Traffic, water, air quality, they all need to be mitigated and
                    or eliminated in whatever plan we come up with. What the framework is will guide the future
                    conceptual and actual designs. So, thank you.

                    I do think it's a wonderful opportunity for reinvestment in our mall.Revitalization, we need to to
                    revitalize it. The developer of the mall, the owner of the mall has been asking for years to make
                    changes. He had a plan that had come before us pre covid that he then paused during covid, and it's
                    unlikely that he will want to go through forward with that same plan because it was a theater and
                    Whole Foods-type grocery store. But you know, post pandemic a theater is probably not something
                    someone is going to invest in at this point, so we're waiting to see what comes back. But it is a
                    wonderful opportunity to have a walkable, residential, mixed use village. It's a very exciting
                    opportunity and that, who I think it was candidate Wallace suggested that it was just wanting to
                    dump housing, in one area. You know, that's the whole thing about plan development right? We
                    wouldn't take them all and and put it in the middle of downtown. There are areas where some
                    development is appropriate and others not. So I will leave it there. I think it's just a wonderful
                    opportunity and I'm looking forward to seeing what is brought forward.

                    thinking about whether or not I wanted to do this and run for this seat, looking ahead at the fact
                    that the city council was going to be charting many of the elements that will be the future of
                    Pleasanton is why I decided to run and Stoneridge Mall is at the heart of that. I do think it's a
                    exciting opportunity for this city to do something that's new and exciting and vibrant, that's mixed
                    use right next to the BART station and transit options. I want to make sure that whatever is done
                    there is done right, which is why I say I'm worried about putting too much or overloading our
                    infrastructure and traffic needs by putting too much housing there, but I do think it's an exciting
                    opportunity to have a planed space that is, as many people have already said, exciting with retail
                    and open space. That also gets a lot of community benefits, maybe a community space and park in that
                    area, and, like was mentioned, the reason the Stoneridge site needs a framework planning process is
                    there are four different owners of the Stoneridge Mall site. So it's bringing those owners together,
                    all the different stakeholders, making sure that we don't have sort of a hodgepodge development
                    there and that it is comprehensive, but it's an exciting opportunity, and like I said before, I want
                    to make sure that the environmental impact report is looked at closely so that we don't overload our
                    infrastructure needs. I also make sure that the community is engaged throughout this process so that
                    whatever gets built there is something that they can support. And I also want to make sure that
                    there's a balanced approach. So it is a very exciting opportunity. If you look at city center and
                    what's that has done for San Ramon, I would love to see something like that done at the Stoneridge
                    Mall site. And it's an extra exciting for me because, like I said earlier, I live right across from
                    Stoneridge Mall, so I'd be able to visit there on a regular basis.

                    Well, I remember when Stoneridge Mall had its grand opening. Shows long I've been around. So it's
                    really sad to me to see how it looks now, a little bit sad. And so I'm looking forward to the
                    revitalization of the Stoneridge Mall area. And I do agree that the framework is really, really
                    important because we need to have continuity between all four of the owners. I think it's also
                    really important to consider what is there because Stoneridge mall brought in a lot of our sales tax
                    revenue, so it's really important that it's planned in such a way that we maximize the amount of
                    sales tax that we can receive from the mall. It's one of our money makers. And if we want to
                    continue to fund all of the amenities that we want in our city, fund our police, and our fire, and
                    our city staff well into the future we need to be focused on our revenues and sales taxes as a huge
                    part of that. So however that gets developed, you need to make sure that we've got good sales tax
                    revenue coming out of the mall. I would like to see some really nice bike paths, you know, so people
                    in town could actually ride their bikes to the mall and not have to use a car, and I think that
                    would be a really great add. But we have so many great examples around the Bay Area of centers that,
                    you know, we all go to and we have to drive far away to, you know, Broadway Plaza, and Santana Row,
                    and now the City Centre. And, you know, if you've been to Europe, a lot of the greatest shopping
                    areas are right near the public transportation, and that's where the shopping has grown from. So I
                    think we have a lot of opportunity, but I would like the our engagement that the city has with this
                    project to be really true and authentic for the citizens. Often times there's too much of a "check
                    the box. What do you think about this plan?" And I really think that the city should invest in some
                    sort of, simulation tool that I've seen used in other cities, kind of like SimCity. So, a lot of
                    community members can really get engaged, get involved, and do a simulation of what the framework
                    would could look like, And I think that'd be super fun.

                    Thank you for the question. The current situation is which the pandemic and with the online
                    shopping, the sales revenue is dropping at the Stoneridge Mall and I believe we are losing some
                    anchor business and I think the first part of the question is everyone probably agree. We need a
                    rethink. We need a reimagine. We need a plan ahead. What we want to do at Stoneridge mall, that part
                    of the city, and to me that's not only a challenge, that's also opportunity. Whenever we are facing
                    this kind of opportunity it's probably happened once in many years, and that's a great opportunity
                    for us to rethink and rethink for our city, for our resident. As an engineer and buisnessman, I
                    handle this kind of opportunity all the time. And to me at the city, as a city council member, I
                    don't have a preset agenda and I don't have any special interest, and what I will do is I will
                    listen to you. I will listen to all the residents in that area, I will listen to all the residents
                    in Pleasanton. I think it's not the "we" design how the Stoneridge Mall looks like, the new
                    Stoneridge Mall look like. It is you and everyone in Pleasanton to develop that. And I want to read
                    a sentence in my website. No matter the issue at hand, my guiding principle will be to listen and
                    collaborate. Listen to you and your concerns, collaborate with your local leaders, and experts in
                    our community to find the best solution for Pleasanton. We hired a consulting firm to to do a
                    framework for us and we want to listen more from you and I think we have the great resource to plan
                    a great opportunity for our bright future. Thank you.

                    You know, I think what's important about the CAP plan is that the city really embrace and walk the
                    walk not just talk the talk because we have not - on the same night that the we were approving, that
                    I approved the CAP 2.0, [I] voted in favor of it of course, we were approving a fleet of vehicles, a
                    fleet of carbon emission vehicles and I questioned why we hadn't looked into, as the CAP plan says
                    we should do, into hybrid or electric vehicles for our fleet vehicles because there were highly
                    rated alternatives that were hybrid. And so that's one of many examples, I've heard from different
                    members of our climate committee is that the City really needs to do a better job of integrating the
                    CAP in our plan, not just expected of our residents and our businesses, but that we need to lead by
                    example. So I think it's a very good plan. We can-- we should always try to achieve more, the
                    state's pushing us to to do more, but I do think it's a really good goal and we need to lead by
                    example.

                    Thank you for the question. I think that when we look at some of the challenges we're facing right
                    now, when it comes to the drought and starting to worry about whether or not we're going to have
                    enough water to meet our needs now and into the future or you look at the heat wave we all just went
                    through in the past week, you see the need for why we need to take action when it comes to climate.
                    I think that the CAP 2.0 plan is an excellent plan and a starting point. I think it's incumbent upon
                    the city to see that through. I think one thing when you watch recent meetings of Commissions and
                    the City Council when it comes to talking about housing element plan, the Stoneridge framework, or
                    the trail master plan, I think one thing that the city needs to do a little bit better job of is
                    bringing them all together and telling residents and also City staff how they play on one another,
                    making sure that there's references to the CAP plan in the housing element plan. For example, I
                    think there could be a better utilization of all the different plans and how they interact done by
                    the city. I also like seeing that we do have things like the trail master plan. I think there are
                    areas where our city can be doing more to encourage more pedestrian traffic more bike lane traffic,
                    putting in protected bike lanes when you can, upgrading our trails to make sure that they can
                    sustain the traffic that they need to have when they're used in different ways, and I also think
                    that we need to do a better job of seeing through some of the plans when it comes to trails or
                    working with East Bay Regional Park District on some of the different plans they have. We can be a
                    better Regional partner with our various Special Districts so that the plans that are in and subject
                    to their jurisdiction interact in a way that makes sense for Pleasanton and meets our climate action
                    goals

                    I work for the government and we do a lot of plans and there's a lot of time and energy that goes
                    into, you know, everybody's sitting around paying consultants to come up with plans and every time
                    I'm always the one in the room that says: "While this plan is great, but how is it going to be
                    implemented? How are people going to know about it? How are people going to put it into their daily
                    work or their daily lives?" So, you know, I'd like to see an addition to the plan that that's not
                    just action, but implementation and that I think we can get somewhere and then we can tweak it as we
                    go to see if we need to do more, which I'm guessing we probably need to do more. You know, I'd
                    really like to, I just really envisioned more people having drought friendly front yards. I just I
                    look around and we're just looking at dead grass now, and wouldn't it be nicer to see drought plants
                    rather than dead grass? But I would really like to see more and more action in the implementation,
                    not just an action plan

                    have as many plans and without execution we still plan is still plan, and that is one of the reason

                    Thank you very much for the question. You know, when I hear the amount of effort that citizens of
                    Pleasanton put in, that committee members, commission members and staff have put in, I'm thrilled
                    that they came up with the CAP 2.0. I read much of it a few weeks ago. It's a very good document. It
                    has lots in it and it's very wide-ranging. Could it do more? Yeah, there are things it could do more
                    of. Does it go far enough to safeguard our children's futures? I think it has lots of actions that
                    the city can follow up on and they should be measured and monitored to be sure they're followed up
                    on. One of the concerns that I have in regard to the greenhouse gases. It's a follow-up on Julie
                    Testa's comments earlier. Our city recently purchased a fleet of vehicles, of carbon-based vehicles.
                    We could have purchased EV vehicles, of course, you know, electric vehicles, but the cost is of
                    course, higher. We're dealing with budget, constraints. It's a matter of choices. The city is facing
                    problems with HPAC in a number of its City facilities such as the Aquatic Park. Instead of just
                    replacing HPAC with in-kind equipment, you, we could upgrade and have equipment that is more
                    climate-friendly. It's like buying a furnace. You have a choice of saying 80% efficient furnace, or
                    you can spend more money and get a 97%. Well, 97%, you know, would accomplish a lot of the goals of
                    reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the city must take a forward acting approach in order to
                    spend the money and determine where the funds are going to come from.

                    Thank you for the question. I think that, you know, like most residents of Pleasanton, I'm also
                    concerned about traffic and traffic congestion on our local streets. I commute to and from Oakland
                    most days to get to work and I'm always kind of looking at my Waze program and trying to decide
                    if I should take the back streets today or stay on the freeway. I think that there are creative
                    solutions that our city can look at doing. One of the things that comes to mind is working with our
                    schools and other partners in the area when it comes to high traffic times and seeing if we could do
                    something about when students are picked up... and when they're let off of school. I also think we
                    could, you know, promote things like ride-sharing and seeing if we could have programs where parents
                    work together to make sure that we alleviate some of the congestion there. And like I said earlier,
                    one of my priorities have elected is to make Pleasanton even more pedestrian and bike friendly and
                    putting in protected bike lanes on our major thoroughfares so that, you know, rather than worrying
                    about whether or not it's safe to take a bike to go to Trader Joe's or wherever it is in the middle
                    of the day, that our biking community and people who want to use bikes can feel safe doing that. I
                    also think that when it comes to West Las Positas Boulevard I would like to see the city act sooner
                    and quicker on the plans that were in there. I think that when it comes to making it a priority on
                    our budget, for me, it would be one of the top priorities. West Las Positas Boulevard is the
                    southern portion of my district, district 1, and doing all we can to alleviate traffic concerns
                    there would be a top priority for me especially when it comes to decisions around our budget.

                    Alright, another big question for not that much time. I think that school traffic is something that,
                    you know, we on the school board always were trying to deal with to get people out of their cars to
                    do you know, the walking school bus, to do more carpooling. It's a really difficult thing to do in
                    this community but I think it's not impossible. I think that it's going to take the whole Community
                    telling people why they need to not drive so much to get their kids to and from school. One of the
                    things that always concerns me is the idling. You know, when people are waiting to do the pickup the
                    idling creates more problems with our air quality, that's always been a concern for me. But I think
                    the main traffic issue is really a regional issue. I think a lot of the cut-through traffic and the
                    traffic coming in and out of Pleasanton is happening because so many people are moving further out
                    and having to commute this direction and so it's giving us a lot of congestion. So it really needs
                    to be a regional effort if we want to deal with the traffic, that's on the freeway. In town traffic,
                    you know, I think like candidate Wallace is saying more bike pads. We're going to see more people be
                    interested in those electric bikes, so we need to be able to have bike paths and places that people
                    can ride those so they can get to and from and that will get people out of their cars and really
                    reduce a lot of the traffic and it will be way easier to park. So yes, this is definitely an issue
                    that the city council should take up at some point and really have a plan for it. I would really
                    support that.

                    Thank you for the question regarding the traffic. We are talking about school-related traffics and
                    talk about the cut-through traffics, and the for school related traffic one of my campaign priority
                    is a strengthening the City at School District's partnership. There are many things that we can work
                    together, and for the the school related traffic on that can be one of the things we work together,
                    which the school and we can work together to think some method and innovative ways to improve the
                    situation. And for cut-through traffic I think on the pandemic has a changed the working habit. Many
                    people work remotely and they don't have to have a long commute from a Stockton and all the way to
                    Silicon Valley area. That helped us a little bit on the highway side, but it doesn't mean that the
                    traffic will not come back. I think we will have to find innovative ways. I'm coming from an
                    engineering background and I see that there are computer apps and sometimes encourage and motivate
                    people to carpool together and we can reduce the number of cars on the street. So there are many
                    things we can think outside of the box to address the traffic issues. Thank you.

                    Thank you very much for the question. Yeah, as a matter of public safety, it gratifies me that
                    Pleasanton residents take such a great concern about the matters of safety around our public schools
                    and the safety of our kids having to contend with traffic. It's a major concern of mine as well.
                    Traffic needs to be a condition that is a topic for all new development in the city. The West Los
                    Positas Improvement project is on the board. It's on the plan for construction in the future. As a
                    member of the bicycle, not only a member but the the vice chair of the Bicycle, Pedestrian, Trails
                    committee I know that the improvement project is being combined with the bicycle and pedestrian
                    trail lane addition to West Las Positas, so that is going to be a great Improvement. Once that
                    happens, it's a matter of of funding and make sure we have the resources necessary to do that. There
                    are number of grant applications that are in process. You know, I pledge, with regard to West Las
                    Positas, the very topic of the question cut through traffic, especially if the West Las Positas 680
                    interchange were ever to be built it would tremendously impact cut-through traffic. We'd have much,
                    much more traffic exiting from 680 onto West Las Positas and transiting through the city to the
                    east. Because this is in my district, I pledge to oppose any construction on that West Las Positas
                    680 Interchange. I know the Caltrans is the owner of the land. It's ultimately their decision, but
                    there are things that as a city we can do to prevent that kind of cut through traffic from making
                    things even worse.

                    Okay, alright, you stole some of the things I was going to share Jeff, good job. So I'll start with
                    the schools. One of the things that concerns me is our schools have always had an enrollment
                    concerns. Even with with covid, it took a worldwide pandemic to actually finally have the decline in
                    enrollment that the school district had been planning for, for a long time. But even with that, it
                    only brought school enrollment down to a level that is below what their increased levels were, but
                    still they're above what our enrollment levels are identified in our Pleasanton general plan. And so
                    with 20% with RHNA, the state is mandating a 20% increase in our housing over the next eight years,
                    there's going to be residential increase and increase students, but the school district still does
                    not, they didn't build the promised Elementary School that had been committed to on the previous
                    bond that we passed. They don't have any plans to build any additional elementary schools or middle
                    schools. There's some talk about a creative high school, but the reason that it's so important right
                    now they're asking that all of their land be rezoned for housing, all of their vacant land be
                    rezoned for housing at a time that we're increasing by 20% of our housing stock. That cross traffic
                    would be caused by that, because this school is full and so the students there have to travel across
                    town, that's the longterm planning that we should be doing and avoiding.

                    The city government is in a critical moment of transition. There is a new city manager, other
                    turnover and key administrative positions, and a clear Council majority that at times is perceived
                    by some as voting on important issues without vigorous debate or working toward an unanimous
                    decision. How will you work with the city, with city manager Jerry Bowden and other City staff as
                    well as your fellow council members to try to get unanimous support, especially on budgetary
                    decisions and other topics that will have significant long-term impact. And secondly, on top of
                    that, what will you do when priorities for your District don't align necessarily with what is best
                    for the entire community?

                    You know, I have 12 years of experience on a public governance board. All of it wasn't always super
                    functional, so I know what it's like to be on a board when things are not a majority, I also know
                    what it's like to be on a majority, so I know the feeling of when things are going great and when
                    things are not. And when things aren't going great the community loses confidence in that body, work
                    doesn't get done, and in the case of our city, in this past year our city manager has left, the city
                    clerk has left, the director of HR has left, and the Director of Finance has left. So there clearly
                    is something going on with the council that all of these very good professional staff of ours have
                    moved on. I think that it's really important that this is this is kind of something that is hard to
                    do or understand unless you're actually in the seat. There's no real training to know how to
                    navigate a situation of being on a dysfunctional board or how you would get to those votes, but I
                    guess the question is how would you get there, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication and
                    probably a lot of offline conversations to build those relationships to come to some common ground.
                    You know, not everybody is going to get along and that's what's wonderful about democracy. It's
                    having those conversations and coming to a compromise to come up with the best solution. But a lot
                    of people um right now on the council can't have those conversations, so the conversations need to
                    happen to be able to make the good decisions. I would really work hard to ensure that that would
                    happen. It's a very big responsibility ability and I have a lot of experience with it.

                    Thank you for the question. I talked, I met and talked with the new city manager, Jerry. We had a
                    very good conversation and I saw his resume and I know he has worked in the city for many years and
                    I have a full confidence on him to lead our city and as a committee member for the committee on

                    have any special interest, I don't have any special agent, I come from a long volunteer activity and

                    with that we will be more easier to find a solution best for our community, for our city, and get
                    all the people agree with each other. And for the second part of the question, um, can you quickly

                    Well thank you very much, I appreciate the question. I too had a meeting with our new city manager
                    Jerry Bowden. Let me tell you, he is a delight to talk to, to learn from. I have full confidence
                    based on my meeting with him and the capabilities and his vision for the future of the city. The
                    priorities for my district, if they were not to align with what's best for the entire community, of
                    course as a council member I would represent the entire city, but also be cognizant of the needs and
                    desires of people in my district. I think part of the approach I would take goes back to the public
                    service values that I mentioned before of being solution centered and being a great teammate,
                    respect for others, listening and serving with a volunteer heart. Highly effective people, one of
                    the uh values of highly effective people according to Stephen Covey is go for win-win and that would
                    be something that I would do. The key to Solutions will be public engagements, regular involvement
                    with City staff outside experts, and the council. And of course substantial follow through to reach
                    agreements and to make sure that actions get done. So to encourage rigorous debates on the council
                    and when fellow council members and to go for uh unanimous decisions I think the same type of
                    thinking would apply. As someone who espouses the values of public service I think it's incumbent
                    upon people to put in the extra mile, putting the extra effort to try to achieve solutions that the
                    vast majority can be satisfied with.

                    Respectful and open-minded is what every council member should bring to the council discussions, the
                    debates, but making unanimous votes and compromising what someone believes I don't think is what we
                    should be looking at doing. I can think of a couple of examples where I was the one on a 4-1 vote,
                    and I really believed my position was valid and relevant and I don't think unanimous is what people
                    should be going for. As long as everyone is listening, willing to, there have been other decisions
                    where I thought I would be going one direction but after listening to the discussion and debate I
                    voted in a different manner because I took into consideration what my colleague said. So I'm a
                    little confused by um I think for someone I would not have a lot of respect for someone who
                    compromises their integrity in their vote. As long as you're open-minded, genuinely trying to
                    understand both or all perspectives I think that's what we should all be going for. As far as the
                    council majority it shifts. Well, there tends to be alignment on some issues. Often we've had votes
                    where it's shifted and it's not the same people thinking the same. As far as the overall Pleasanton,
                    I've already been on the council where we looked at Pleasanton as a whole and I'm disappointed by
                    the districts but I've committed and we've all committed to looking at the overall best interest of
                    Pleasanton. I will only say one more thing and that is I will ask candidate Yee how many
                    superintendents she went through on her time on the school board.

                    Thank you for the question. To start off with my answer to this one, a lot has been said about my
                    current boss, I want to make clear what my current role is. I am not in fact a legislative staffer
                    for my boss. I'm her district director and my history of work for candidates including Congressman
                    Eric Swalwell our current candidate has been either serving as a field director for them on their
                    campaigns or in this case the district director for my current boss. And in approaching those jobs,
                    key to it is building teams to knock on doors and talk to voters or building teams to help
                    constituents in our districts. And, when it comes to my work for the assembly member I work for,
                    managing her district office means managing teammates who have to interact in many ways with
                    constituents who a lot of times come to us upset about something they're dealing with or they come
                    to us wanting to find a solution and have no idea how to find it. So we work hard to get those
                    constituents the help they need and to show them the ways we can help them and then, you know, if we
                    show empathy and we're collaboratively with them and listen to them we get things done. So I think
                    that I would bring that experience of working collaboratively with folks to get to solutions if
                    elected. I also want to say that you know, when it comes to the city council if you watch the past
                    year of decisions there have been a lot of decisions made by this council in which residents didn't
                    feel that they were appropriately communicated with. A few of them that come to mind is the decision
                    whether or not to have Donlon field on the housing element plan, the decision on where the water
                    recycling plant station was placed, and more recently the city serve situation. I think all these
                    are indicative of a failure of both leadership and communication by our current Council and if
                    elected I want to help rectify those situations.

                    Okay, this has been fun. I know. It's a sick, kind of fun, but it's fun. So I'd like to start by
                    saying, you know, what do you red-winged blackbirds and tall curbs on Main Street, for the horse
                    carriages and the first traffic lights in Pleasanton all have in common? These are some of the many
                    things that I remember since my parents moved us here from Berkeley in 1969. Change does happen.
                    I've been reflecting about all the changes and the growth over the years. I wonder what it would've
                    been like if the council the city council 50 years ago had a housing cap and didn't approve any
                    housing. Today we would not have Pleasanton Meadows, Val Vista, Birdland, Del Prado, and the Valley
                    Trails neighborhood. Today, these are many of the neighborhoods people choose to move to and to
                    attend our high quality education programs. I encourage residents of Pleasanton to get involved and
                    engaged to help shape the future of Pleasanton. Smart and planned growth is important to the
                    financial future and the quality life we all do really value. We need reasonable discussions for
                    reasonable solutions. I envision Pleasantons continued success through measured growth, sustainable
                    financial resources. Our city will be safe and secure through its fire and police departments, and
                    it will be a city where children will also want to live and raise their families. We will enjoy
                    maintained -- well-maintained city spaces, thriving businesses, clean and safe water, and increase
                    community engagement and involvement. The character of Main Street still remains iconic, and the
                    Museum on Main receives more community support to be able to do more education to our residents to
                    help them learn about our past so they'll be able to move into the future without fear. I have a
                    proven track record of 12 years in public governance and oversight of 160 million plus budget
                    setting policy, hiring, and had the pleasure of supervising the PUSD superintendents and experience
                    working with and collaboratively with the PUSD staff. I have a deep understanding of our community,
                    experience with constituent engagement, and understanding of labor negotiations and the role of a
                    city council member. I plan to live here in Pleasanton for the rest of my life. And all the
                    decisions made by the city council will affect me and my family for the rest of my days. I'm deeply
                    and truly invested. I have the courage and dedication to keep this city on track. Should I be
                    fortunate enough to be elected to this city council I would be the first Asian American woman to be
                    elected since the city became a city in 1894. The last person of color on the city council was Floyd
                    Murray, which was 1972 to 1975. That was 47 years ago. Our community is now 37 percent Asian and its
                    time to balance the representation of our community. District 3, I would be honored to have your
                    vote. And please visit my website, jamieyee.com. Thank you,

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    Thank you again to the Pleasanton weekly for hosting us tonight. You know, when I was first deciding
                    whether or not I wanted to do this, whether or not I wanted to run for Pleasanton city council, I
                    met with people who I respect admire and who care about me and what I tell them is, if I do this, I
                    do run for City Council, I want to change the tone of the housing discussion here in Pleasanton.
                    And, these being people who love and care about me, their response, usually was something like:
                    "Dean, I don't think it's a good idea to talk about housing in Pleasanton." And, while these folks
                    meant well, and wanted the best for me, I am running because I want to change the tone of the
                    housing discussion here in Pleasanton, because I don't think it's okay that we're failing so many of
                    our young people here in Pleasanton, and I don't think it's okay that some people take the position
                    that our graduates of Amador and Village and Foothill of tomorrow will just have to come to terms
                    with the fact that they won't be able to come back here to Pleasanton in the future, that they won't
                    be able to call Pleasanton their home again in the future because they can't afford to live here.
                    But, as I've been running my campaign, I've seen reasons for hope. As I mentioned earlier, the city
                    of Pleasanton recently did a survey in which they asked the residents of Pleasanton "What is the one
                    issue you want to see the city of Pleasanton, this city council, do something about?" And number
                    one, on that list was the lack of affordable housing options in Pleasanton and the cost of housing
                    in Pleasanton. And I have hope, because when I knock on doors and talk to parents of younger
                    children who are in our schools who moved here for the schools and who took out a 1.5 or two million
                    dollar mortgage on their home and probably used the entire life savings for the down payment on the
                    home. They're worried about whether their kids will be able to live in the future. Or I talk to
                    parents of kids who moved away to Portland or Austin or Seattle, they tell me they lament the fact
                    that their kids can't live here anymore because they can't afford to live here. And when I go to
                    events and I talk about housing, what I've been enjoying is when people come up to me afterwards and
                    say, in varying degrees of whispers, "Dean no I agree with you on housing." So, I am running to
                    change the tone on housing here in Pleasanton, and I do believe that our city needs to be doing much
                    more to promote affordable housing and build more housing here in Pleasanton, especially workforce
                    housing for our teachers and first Responders and younger workers in a way that makes sense for
                    Pleasanton and fits our communities character and charm. And in a way that is supported by our
                    infrastructure and traffic needs. And also in a way that protects and preserves our neighborhoods'
                    public safety. And it would be an honor if I could earn your vote to work on doing just that as a
                    member of the Pleasanton City Council. Thank you.

                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    Pleasanton is a beautiful place for all and a wonderful place for children to grow and flourish
                    which is why many of us were drawn here. I raised my family in Pleasanton and have been active in
                    the community for more than 30 years, advocating for schools and supporting families. I have worked
                    to balance infrastructure, water, schools, roads, and service with housing, growth, and development
                    through statewide advocacy. Harrison Street, a five-story in the middle of our downtown with zero
                    parking, is only the beginning. It is the first. We've identified there are many other sites in
                    Downtown that could follow and completely changing what we love about the heart of Pleasanton. But
                    it's not just that. When I get a phone call from a supporter, very agitated, very upset, saying
                    "Julie, why didn't I get a postcard? How did this happen with?" And I'm trying to understand what
                    they're upset about. And they said: "A truck pulled out in front of my house and a crane lifted a
                    house off of it and dropped it in my neighbor's backyard where I had, only hours earlier, sunlight
                    and privacy. Now, I have a 16-foot wall of an ADU." That's what local control is being moved. We've
                    always allowed ADUs, but we would have, in the past had the opportunity for that house, that was
                    dropped in someone's backyard, to come before Planning Commission and then City Council and we could
                    have said: "You can do the ADU, because we certainly allowed ADUs, but it has to be done in a way
                    that doesn't have that impact on your neighbor." Do you know that a truck can pull in front of your
                    neighbor's house and they can drop a house in their front yard? Do you understand what has happened
                    and how things have changed? When we hear about the need for affordability. That is a, those are
                    economic factors. That is not something that supply and demand and dropping houses on someone's
                    front yard is going to cure. What we need to do, we need our legislators to be creating laws that
                    take on the real issue and those are economic issues because they all know that the laws that
                    they're passing in Sacramento that allow a house to drop in your neighbor's front yard or your other
                    neighbor to build a four-plex or six-plex and instead of the one house that was there, or as my,
                    dear friend, Mary Reading, lives three houses down from the Harrison project, she is now going to
                    have, where there was one lovely house with a picket fence in the Rose Garden for the last 50 years,
                    there's going to be a monolithic project with no parking that absolutely will cost us a fortune in
                    trying to mitigate the traffic, the parking impacts that will be caused by that. And by the way, the
                    city absolutely looked at everything that we could possibly look at to work with the developer to do
                    something different and they just weren't, it wasn't possible. We really did try. So we need to
                    really look at what our options as a city are. This isn't a lack of desire to build housing. We did
                    three hundred percent of our market rate housing in the last cycle. We need to have local control
                    and decision-making on how that's done.

                    Thank you very much. Thank you to the Pleasanton Weekly again for staging the forum. I am running
                    for City Council in District 1 which encompasses Northwest Pleasanton. To summarize my priorities
                    they are: 1) the utmost in public safety and emergency preparedness, support of our police and fire
                    departments, and other professionals that are responsible for Public Safety in our city is
                    paramount. Smart growth. Growth must be measured, as the city has been doing and has done great job
                    of in the past, and provide housing for our children, ur teachers and our city workers. We must do a
                    better job of creating affordable housing. We have done in the past, the city has the capability,
                    they can do in the future. We've accomplished such previous projects as [conjugate Gardens and
                    sunflower Hill]. The City of San Ramon recently, as publishing the Pleasanton Weekly, I believe
                    accomplished a development of 123 senior living units. We could do the same. There's no reason why
                    Pleasanton can't move forward in areas such as affordable housing, and to do it in ways that are
                    planned and fit in with the character of Pleasanton. Also safe drinking water coming out of our
                    taps. All residents expect our drinking water was coming into our sink to be safe. We as a city must
                    ensure that our drinking water meets all applicable regulatory standards, especially with regards to
                    PFAS. If we need to build a treatment facility and we have the wells, it costs forty six million
                    dollars as has been proposed and that the evaluations of alternatives show that that is borne out,
                    then, in working with the council, the city staff, and experts, perhaps that's the opportunity and
                    the option that is chosen. If it is getting other Regional water quality supplies from Zone 7,
                    again, having studied all the options and alternatives if that works out and it's the smart thing to
                    do then that option should be chosen. And I think the plan of record of the treatment facility and
                    the well rehab is technically sound and we just need to make sure that as a project, it meets all of
                    our objectives and will deliver final result that is in keeping with the deliverables that
                    Pleasanton requires. Restaurants and retail in our historic downtown are critical to keeping a
                    vibrant destination for dining, shopping, entertainments, and socializing. It is vital that we do
                    what we can to increase foot traffic to enhance the retail environment and to attract other
                    businesses to locate downtown. We need to improve the experience of being downtown. We need to
                    improve cultural amenities. These are things that can be done. Also the Stoneridge Mall area will be
                    reimagined through the new framework and the following conceptual designs and other plans that will
                    occur after that. We have opportunities for new amenities, with all of our residents to enjoy, all
                    while preventing or mitigating adverse impacts that inevitably will arise in the consideration of
                    all of the factors.
