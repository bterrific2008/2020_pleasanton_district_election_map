                    as the chair of the committee on energy and the environment for our city and I'm also a Tri-Valley

                    school age children, I care a lot about the safety and sustainability My top priority is Public
                    Safety. Support for our First Responders is essential, including our alternate mental health
                    program. I support the furthering environmental sustainability and the collaboration with our
                    partners, including the school district and Zone 7. As an engineering manager I have led a
                    multi-million dollar businesses and managed large budget. I will use my professional experience to
                    make certain the city stays on a fiscally sustainable path. As your council member, I will work hard
                    to enhance our small town atmosphere. To learn more about me please visit votejoelliu.com. Thank
