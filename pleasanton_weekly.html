                    Thank you for the opportunity. I'm Joel Liu, I'm running for president city council District 3.
                    I'm an engineer, with a PHD in electrical engineering. I started to work in Pleasanton in 2008. Anda
                    few years later, our family choose to call Pleasanton home because of its safety and great
                    schools. I have always been passionate about volunteering and giving back to the community. I
                    currently serve as the chair of the committee on energy and the environment for our city and I'm
                    also a Tri-Valley representative at the community advisory committee at EBCE. I was a recently
                    honored to receive one of the eight volunteerism awards from my employer among 90,000 global
                    employees. As a father of two school age children, I care a lot about the safety and sustainability
                    My top priority is Public Safety. Support for our First Responders is essential, including our
                    alternate mental health program. I support the furthering environmental sustainability and the
                    collaboration with our partners, including the school district and Zone 7. As an engineering manager
                    I have led a multi-million dollar businesses and managed large budget. I will use my professional
                    experience to make certain the city stays on a fiscally sustainable path. As your council member, I
                    will work hard to enhance our small town atmosphere. To learn more about me please visit

                    Most of all, the residents of Pleasanton deserve a council member who has demonstrated a true
                    volunteer heart and dedication. As a longtime volunteer with youth Civic church and professional
                    organizations, I take to heart the public service values of being solution-centered, of being a
                    great teammate, of showing respect for everyone, of listening, and of serving the residents of
                    Pleasanton. What I will do is have a laser focus on the priorities of the citizens of Pleasanton and
                    on solving the challenges before us. There are many, and we will do it with gusto and pride and
                    go-to-idness. What will I not do? I will not run for higher office. I will not accept donations from
                    builders and developers because it is important to be independent when it comes to considering
                    building projects that may come before the council. I will not bring someone else's agenda to the
                    city council. As a planning, commissioner and city council member, my only bosses are the residents
                    of Pleasanton. Thank you very much. Please visit my website at votejeffnibert.com.

                    Good evening, and thank you to the Pleasanton Weekly for hosting this forum. My name is Julie Testa
                    and I am seeking a second term in the newly created District 3. My first term, as city council
                    member was a historic one due to the pandemic and many ways that all levels of government had to
                    pivot in the face of safety and public health. Through the Challenges posed by covid-19, the
                    Pleasanton city council still advanced many important projects and programs. The rebuilt Fire
                    Station 3 which will be completed next month. The Downtown parking corridor will soon be completed
                    and add another 81 parking spaces to downtown, and through it all, Pleasanton emerged from the
                    global shutdown in a fiscally strong position. I'm very pleased that our city council, by an
                    unanimous vote passed an initiative that I championed: a pilot alternative response program. It
                    provides our stellar police Pleasanton Police Department with a new tool, two licensed mental health
                    clinicians to respond to designated calls for service. The program provides support to our officers
                    and is a win-win for everyone involved. Do you know that 94 percent of residents say Pleasanton is
                    an excellent or good place to live? In a second term as your Pleasanton city council member, I will
                    continue to prioritize residents interests over special interests, preserve Pleasanton's historic
                    downtown and small town character and excellent liveability, promote and support public safety
                    resources, promote clean, water conservation. And finally, I will push back on state-required,
                    excessive housing mandates. I have 30 years plus experience and commitment to advocating for
                    residents and businesses of Pleasanton. I have worked hard and I would appreciate your vote.

                    Thank you to the Pleasanton weekly for hosting us tonight. My name is Dean Wallace. And I'm running
                    to bring a forward-looking perspective to the Pleasanton city council, that of someone who's lived
                    in the Tri-Valley for over 20 years. I went to high school and graduated from high school here in
                    the Tri-Valley, and came back after college to live close to family. I understand firsthand the
                    challenges that are facing our young Working Families and young professionals. This is the first
                    year that Pleasanton is going to district-based elections and district One is full of some of
                    Pleasanton's most vibrant businesses and communities. It's home to Hacienda Business Park and
                    StoneRidge Mall. It's home to both our Bart stations and its home to many of our parks and Open
                    Spaces. District one is also the most generationally socioeconomically and ethnically diverse
                    District in our city. It's home to many of our immigrant families. I myself am an immigrant. I was
                    born in Dublin, Ireland and moved here with my father who is Irish and my mother who is Mexican and
                    I was very proud to become a citizen of this country in 2011 and I love the fact that my community
                    is so diverse. It is also the most generationally diverse District in Our city. It's home to many of
                    our most well-established single-family neighborhoods and also many of our largest apartment
                    communities in Pleasanton. in fact, 25% of Pleasanton is renters, I myself am a renter Who aspires
                    to be a homeowner someday. I bring with me over a decade of experience working for local elected
                    officials On many of the most important and pressing issues facing our community. And if elected I
                    pledged to work closely with our residents listening to them, and working to improve and maintain
                    our high quality of life, Preserve Public Safety, continue the strong partnership between our
                    schools and our city, promote economic vitality, and to preserve a fiscally responsible budget. And
                    I'd be honored to earn your vote to do that On the city council, my website is www.deanwallace.com.

                    Yes, thanks to the Pleasanton weekly and also, I guess Roberta Gonzales' production company. Yes, I
                    can't think what it's called, but this is new for us. So thank you for for participating. I am Jamie
                    Yee, resident of council District 3, and you may remember me from my time serving as a trustee on
                    the Pleasanton Unified School District for 12 years from 2008 to 2020. I represented the school
                    district on the city's economic Vitality commission from 2013 to 2020. I'm currently a Member of the
                    Civic Arts commission and co-chair of the Tri-Valley chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander American
                    public affairs Association. We can all agree that housing, safe and healthy, drinking water and
                    Public Safety are our priorities but I also believe that protecting Pleasanton's quality of life,
                    supporting Public Safety efforts collaboration and partnership with the school district, maintaining
                    fiscal sustainability, and balancing modern city needs while safeguarding the character of Main
                    Street are Equally important. I'm uniquely qualified because of my previous board governance
                    experience in providing oversight of a public entity. I will ask the tough questions, engage in open
                    minded, civil transparent discussion, and consider the community's needs and desires before voting.
                    I've held many volunteer positions, including many PTA leadership roles that led to eight years on
                    the State Board. I was appointed to the California Department of education's Environmental literacy
                    task force and represented the school district as a try Valley ROP board member. In 2007 I was
                    recognized as the California State Assembly, woman of the year for my advocacy efforts for School
                    nurses and school health services. I'm a very a native whose parents moved to Pleasanton in 1969,
                    And I graduated from Foothill as a senior class president. professionally I'm employed by the
                    Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, and I bring that public health perspective. I'm looking
                    forward to tonight's questions and answers, and thank you again to the Pleasanton weekly for hosting
                    this event.

                    Well, thank you very much for the question. I truly appreciate it. We all agree That more affordable
                    housing is needed in Pleasanton. I support increased development of affordable housing in places
                    where it's appropriate and makes sense. The city has already been successful with affordable housing
                    and we will do more. as a planning Commissioner, we are planning for it right now. But there's a bad
                    bill that my opponents boss wrote that is at the governor's desk. it's called AB-2011. It will
                    expand the kind of thing that's happening on Harrison Street to retail and Commercial zones. AB 2011
                    strips away local expertise and standard processes. Developers will be able to just check off the
                    boxes and the city must give them a permit. No Planning Commission review, no city council review,
                    and no public engagement. not all cities are built the same or plan the same. These
                    one-size-fits-all laws will provide No, support from the state for infrastructure. We need our
                    retail and commercial zones. The businesses in them create jobs and provide revenues that the city
                    relies on to provide services and create amenities. by replacing commercial zones with residential
                    housing It creates critical local Revenue loss. with this bill there is no way for the city to
                    intervene to mitigate the economic loss. Retail and commercial zones are supposed to include our
                    current and hopeful future restaurant and small business owners. Ab 2011, undermines our housing
                    element that we are in the middle of creating. if developers can simply build in retail and
                    Commercial zones that are unsuitable for housing, why are we as a city doing all this planning work?

                    I'm very concerned. I share Jeff Nibert's candidate Nibert's concerns about the state overreach in
                    our community. We, in our last RHNA cycle, we actually built 370 affordable housing units. So
                    Pleasanton is doing their share. in fact, Pleasanton build a higher percentage of our affordable
                    housing than any other city in Alameda County percentage-wise, and yet everybody can achieve their,
                    their market rate. we built three hundred percent of our market rate housing. But even being the top
                    producer top percentage of our RHNA requirement we still didn't come close to meeting our affordable
                    housing goals. The state housing numbers are unrealistic. They've been proven to be false. There was
                    a State Legislative audit that proved that they're false and we must push back on the state. I think
                    working Toward our affordable housing goals is imperative and the state has to help us with the
                    funding because we've been set up to fail. They know, we do not have the 1.5 billion dollars in
                    subsidy that would be required to build our, our RHNA affordable housing requirements.

                    Thank you for the question. I want to start off by saying one thing, my boss, While, I am proud to
                    work for her, she is not on the ballot. I also want to say that when asked about what they think the
                    top issue that this city council must address in a recent survey done by the city of Pleasanton. The
                    number one thing that the people of Pleasanton said in that survey was something about the lack of
                    affordable housing options and the cost of housing here in Pleasanton. And in that same survey, the
                    amount of people who said that the cost of housing in Pleasanton was a serious or very serious
                    concern was 70% that same survey said that those who think that the cost of living and the lack of
                    affordable, housing options for our workers that was at 50%. Those who say, there's too much
                    development here in Pleasanton, that was only 29 percent. I think this city council needs to have
                    more of a focus on increasing affordable housing here in Pleasanton. I live in the Stoneridge Mall,
                    which is sorry. I live across from the Stoneridge Mall which is one of the top locations that this
                    city has identified in the housing element plan on which to build housing and so, I want to make
                    sure that it's done, right. And right, for me means three things. First, It means that we look
                    closely at the environmental impact report So, that whatever is done, there is done in a way that is
                    sustainable according to our traffic and infrastructure needs. Two, that we engage the residents of
                    District 1, in a way, that makes sure that they are supportive of whatever goes in there. And three,
                    it is done in a way that [Note: moderator cuts Wallace off at this point due to time]

                    Yes. Housing is definitely an issue in our community and one of the things that I hear over and over
                    again, is I really hope that my kids can afford to move back here so I don't have to move away
                    somewhere to see grandchildren. I think it's really important for us to focus about that because
                    this community is the way that it is because of so many generations that have been able to live
                    here. it's really given our community that character that we all love so much, So I think the
                    council really needs to balance, what is required by the state at our desire to have more affordable
                    housing. And I really believe that if we have a functional Council that can work together, we can
                    figure out ways to make that happen. We do live under SB 35, that says that we have to retain local
                    control or the state will retain local control, but it does kind of penalize communities that are
                    blocking Building their housing so that developers get to streamline their process and not have to
                    go through the normal approval processes, which is a little bit problematic for us, so we need to
                    pay attention to that, so we don't have, So we're not losing our local control. Workforce housing is
                    something that I've been a huge advocate for, for many, many years. being on the school board, it
                    was painfully obvious to us that teachers could not live in our community, So, Workforce housing is
                    definitely something that this Council needs to look at. Thank you.

                    Thank you for the question. Housing is very critical issue in our city and we, we have seen the
                    Mandat from the state and we are required to build, almost 6,000 housing unit. And the city council
                    is, has a gone through the review of the housing unit and submitted the plan, as I understand, And
                    right now is under the EIR, environmental impact review, and for us, we need to continue to go this
                    route, we need to continue to plan, and we needed to advocate for local control. We cannot have a
                    sacramental to to do to develop a bill like sb 35 and too too get rid of our local controls. we can
                    not they have high-rise a five-story building without the parking. And also we need a housing for
                    our workforce for our teachers and firefighters.

                    So, I want to start out by saying, as all residents of Pleasanton feel, I really love the character
                    and charm of our downtown. I went on dates in high school in downtown Pleasanton And I used to study
                    and read at Tully's before it became Pete's. So, my affinity for downtown has been long-standing. I
                    think the city has some great programs in place that have been helping to support and Revitalize our
                    downtown: Weekends on Main, the parklet programs, all those things I am fully supported of. I think
                    there are areas that we can improve though. I think we can look into doing more for pedestrian, bike
                    safty downtown, and across the city. I think we could also look at doing more to solve the
                    never ending saga that is parking in downtown, so that no one has to constantly worry about whether
                    or not they can park in that Bank of America parking spot. But I also think that when it comes to
                    downtown, we need To look at revitalizing it in this way. I think we need to be promoting and
                    inviting more small businesses to do business in downtown Pleasanton. And I think, right now that
                    the council is a little bit over doing the micromanaging of our downtown. we have this active floor,
                    use policy in which there's a lot being done to measure where desks and tables and what sold in a
                    small business. I would like to see us pull back from that and instead fill those empty storefronts
                    in our downtown.

                    Well, I think that we need to do it with a balanced approach, but I do think we need to keep in mind
                    that for small businesses, which make up a lot of our business owners in in Pleasanton is that
                    they're faced with, you know, rising cost of goods and services and that makes it difficult for them
                    to stay competitive. We need to keep that in mind. We also need to keep in mind that it's very
                    difficult for our businesses to attract and retain a adequate Workforce. And small businesses are
                    also facing tax increases and Regulatory fees, state and local that are really difficult for our
                    small businesses. So we need to keep that in mind as we move forward and plan and balance things.
                    So, you know, if we wanted to make some new ordinance, you know about something environmental that
                    they had to do. You know, we really need to keep in mind that they already have a lot of these,
                    these stresses on them already. So I think we need to look at things, you know, in a all the way
                    around picture and not just you know, one side and just only environmental and it's got all work
                    together. But really we need to keep in mind what the small businesses are facing every day to stay
                    competitive and stay in business, because they're very, very much a part of our Vibrant Community
                    and definitely needed their part of what makes Pleasanton Pleasanton.

                    Pleasanton residents rely on it, for dining, for shopping for entertainment and for socializing. My

                    policy to establish 100% use. The policy as it now stands does not require extensive measurements.

                    of the city's annual water supply, are in need of rehabilitation or replacement. In addition, the
                    water contains a presence of PFAS chemicals, Contaminants the state is currently developing
                    restrictions on. In June 2021, the city was ready to take on the implementation of PFAS treatments
                    and well repairs, but those plans were paused by the council just last week. Do you think the city

                    Thank you for that question. I think this is one of the most important questions that we're going to
                    face this election cycle. When it comes to PFAS or the forever chemicals that are seeping into our
                    water supply, there's a lot of uncertainty and anxiety understandably around this issue. You know,
                    as you mentioned, the state and federal governments are currently looking at the most recent
                    research on PFAS and coming up with new regulations and standards for what is an acceptable level of
                    PFAS in our drinking water. And as you said, the city recently put a pause on its plans and I think
                    that given all the uncertainties that currently exists around what an acceptable level is, what the
                    cost will be, what's currently in the water, I think that pause was a good thing. I think that we
                    have to, as a city, continue to work closely with our partners in the region and in the water space,
                    including Zone 7 and DSRSD. I support looking into all the possible solutions to this problem which
                    includes blending of water, greater treatment of water, or further, or looking for new supplies of
                    water. But I think the North Star in all of this and what I want to emphasize is that we must as a
                    city ensure that we have a safe reliable and sustainable supply of drinking water for the residents
                    in Pleasanton. Thank you.

                    able to do the work that they need to do to come up with some recommendations and be able to do the
                    research and all of that takes staff time and we need to prioritize the water issue and and let some
                    other things, slides, that the staff has the adequate time to bring recommendations. But I think
                    that, you know, Zone 7 is our water authority, and we should be looking closer to them. I know
                    that in the past that wasn't always a great relationship between the city and zone seven, but I
                    think that it has to be. Zone Seven is our water authority. We need to have a good relationship
                    there and we really need to make sure that we're looking at data before we make any real decisions.
                    And I think that that is still to come, but the pause was a good idea.

                    Thank you for the question. We all want the safe water. As a councilmember getting safe water is my
                    top priority. In Pleasanton, the water issue is a little bit complicated. We have aging wells and we
                    have the drought, and we needed to work with our partners and to deal with the PFAS issue. For this
                    complicated issue there is an engineering part; there is also a business part. Engineering part is,
                    this is a new issue. What technology we needed to choose? Buisness part is, does it make business
                    sense? As a PhD in engineering and worked on water treatment project on the electrical side before,
                    I believe what I'm well qualified to understand that the technical part. And as a leader who has
                    managed the multi-million dollar projects and the business, I believe I'm qualified to understand
                    the business part also. I agree with the current Council. We should pause. We need to pause and the
                    think what to do. And there are many things for us to think and I'm qualified to help the council to
                    decide the best option for our resident to get the safe water. Thank you.

                    Thank you. As an engineer and a project management professional I have a perspective on this that comes from managing many such large projects in the past. As a project manager, you need to consider a number of things when managing a project. Cost is certainly one of them. Schedule, resources, and the scope of the project. It's appropriate when planning for a project that when you scope things out, when you are deciding what to do, you learn the risks and the response plans that you intend to have for those risks, you plan out what you intend to do in the case of any of those risk materializing. In this case, we had concerns that the staff identified as with regard to the cost of the program: the capital cost as well as operation and maintenance costs. The concern about resources that the new treatment and well rehab system would require in the future. Concerns about regulations and future regulations that could impose additional requirements on the system. So I support the decision of the council to take a pause right now and take a look at what the alternatives are, the regional water quality supply alternatives. In the meantime, the treatment option remains the plan of record. It's still a viable option and it's one that I would support if it is indeed selected. I do have concerns about water quality reliability from Zone 7.

                    Well, I'm so glad that everyone agrees that we made a good decision. It was a hard decision though because we do know that the acceptable levels will be different very soon and just because the identified levels are different doesn't change the risk that is currently involved in the water that has the PFAS. There should be no PFAS in our water. It's a man-made chemical. It doesn't, there should be zero. And I think that the acceptable levels are going to continue to go down because there really should be none. But there's an urgency because we shut down one well and we know that with the change of levels we're almost certainly going to be shutting down the other wells. We do have short-term options, and that would be to purchase water, more water, instead of just 80 percent of our water from Zone 7 we will be purchasing more of it. So while I think the pause was necessary, we should look at our options. There's also an urgency so I believe we're going to be talking about this again, very soon. Thank you.
