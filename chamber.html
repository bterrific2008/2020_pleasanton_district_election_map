                    Do you support having the City of Pleasanton take the lead on a conversation with the Stoneridge
                    Mall developers and the Harrison Street developer to propose affordable housing on the Stoneridge
                    site and market-rate housing on Harrison? Why or why not?

                    So affordable on Stoneridge. I think, just from listening to some of the conversation, there are
                    four different owners at the Stone Ridge mall. So I do think it's going to take a lot of
                    conversation and planning to figure out what works. The owners have expressed some concern about
                    building all affordable because they just won't make any money doing that. So I think it's It's
                    going to really take some rolling up, some sleeves and having the right people at the right table to
                    have those discussions. To figure out how to have affordable. Do I think there should be affordable
                    at Stoneridge? Absolutely, you know. It just came to my attention that in the school district we
                    have 122 teachers that make up about 20% of our School District staff, and they actually are
                    products of our own of our own Community. They went to school here. So I'm very curious to find out
                    how many can actually afford to live here, could we have market rate at Harrison straight? I don't
                    know if that developer would be interested in having market rate, but if they were, I would be all
                    for it. If it included parking and wasn't five stories high.

                    Thanks. I do support the city, taking the lead on a conversation with the developers at Stoneridge
                    Mall to propose affordable housing. There, I do not support having the stone, having a city leaders
                    had that conversation with Harrison Street to have market rate. Their the one saving grace of
                    Harrison Street is that it is all 100% affordable housing right now. As much as I disagree with a
                    quitting location there and it's night and it's it's not fitting in with character of the community
                    not fitting with the downtown plan. The saving grace is that it's all horrible. I'm involved with
                    playing commission as someone who helped create the draft housing element that was approved by the
                    city council and is now before the state were review, the Planning Commission designated in the
                    areas around the BART stations, including the one here Stoneridge, or in denser housing as a result
                    of a need. To be smart about where housing is located for Transit oriented development. That,
                    however, is a mixed-use concept, all of the housing there will not be 100% affordable and be
                    commercial would be residential as well as housing. So the whole needs of the entire Community are
                    being considered there. I was at the Stoneridge framework Workshop, that was held on Monday, 153
                    people joined the large attendance, the whole area needs to be part of the comprehensive plan for
                    what happens at Stoneridge.

                    Housing is very critical issue for our city and we are going through the housing element
                    discussions. And there are many places we can look into and Stoneridge Mall Area is one of that for
                    the most part of the reason. The city council has already approved the framework and that's a great
                    opportunity for us to develop the greater and the new area for for our city, for the rule of the
                    city. I would support the city council to participate at the conversation so we should developers. I
                    think the city council row is a zoning, is now the building but we should talk, which all parties
                    and they invited them and bring new ideas for us to, to the, to the, to the better future Alpha
                    Pleasanton. And for stonetree small area, I would like to see that a variety of housing, not only
                    affordable housing. And for Harrison Street, for that, what I again, I would support the
                    participation of the discussions that we should developers. Thank you

                    Thank you for the question James. And actually going to relate this question to the question, we
                    just answered in her saying that. I don't think it's the role of the city council to be doing either
                    of those things, the city is currently going through as others have mentioned, variety of different
                    processes to decide what works for the city. The housing element plan at the broader level, for the
                    city, identifying sites where housing can go. And then here in district 1, Stoneridge element,
                    sorry, the Stoneridge work plan, which will help bring together all the stakeholders, including the
                    community, the owners of the land, and other groups that will be impacted to see, what makes the
                    most sense there. I also attended with see plant planning commissioner knivert, the Stone, Ridge
                    Mall Frameworks, First Community event, the other day and sitting through that. It's just very clear
                    that we're in the very early stages of deciding. What will go there? So, I'm supportive of having,
                    you know, affordable housing, their market rate, housing mixed-use, housing, whatever makes the most
                    sense after that process is what I think is most appropriate to go there. Same with the Harrison
                    Street project, I wouldn't want to dictate what goes there. I would help to you know as a city
                    council member guide the city through these various different processes to make sure that whatever
                    gets done is something the community agrees with.

                    You mentioned workforce housing, workforce housing is different from the low-income housing and very
                    low income housing that's called for in our Regional Housing Need allocation numbers for which we
                    designed the housing element. Workforce housing is housing for our teachers, for our city employees,
                    for police and firefighters, for those who can't afford to live in Pleasanton because of the high
                    housing costs and this would include children of residents as well. The locations for such workforce
                    housing could be any of the twenty four areas that have been identified, rather 23 I guess since we
                    excluded Donlan, that have been identified in the draft housing element. Places for the achievement
                    of low income and very low income housing are things that need to be penciled out by developers. The
                    City can't force developers to build on any of these properties. The city can encourage and by its
                    policies support the construction of mixed use properties and also properties that are and can be
                    100% affordable, 100% affordable meaning, in the RHNA context, to apply to low and very low income.
                    But as far as workforce housing goes for all of our employees and City residents, that can be any of
                    the identified sites in the housing element and I would encourage that.

                    Thank you for that question. I would not name any of the locations. I think that the city council
                    has selected 25 sites, and after Donlan site, we still have our 24 site and we already identified
                    those site, hopefully, those are meeting the requirement of the RHNA numbers and we are waiting for
                    the EIR, the environmental impact report. I would wait for results of the environmental impact
                    report and then work together to find the best locations for workhouse --workforce housing. I take
                    workforce housing as a very important topic because I do want our teachers and firefighters and
                    police officers and other professional workers on to be able to live in the city and the close to
                    where they work. I would not name, again, a location. I would wait for the EIR and then find out
                    what's the best location for the workforce housing.

                    Thank you for the question. So when it comes to workforce housing, I think it's important to start
                    by answering this question with how you go about making workforce housing. So workforce housing is
                    housing that we, you know, identify as being for teachers, first responders, younger workers. You
                    have to identify who in the workforce you're looking to make that housing for. And then you have to
                    have the city and regional partners, or the state or another entity help fund it because you're kind
                    of you got to build the housing, subsidized it, and get the resources needed to make it, you know,
                    specifically workforce housing. So one of the sites or a couple of sites that come to mind for
                    workforce housing is the school district sites. I could see us doing workforce housing for our
                    teachers there. I've talked to a couple of our city school board members who have expressed interest
                    and excitement about the possibility. There are various other cities in this state that have brought
                    together the school district, and the city, and nonprofits and gotten grants from the state and
                    other entities to build that workforce housing for teachers. So I think, you know, you'd have to
                    work with those the school board to make sure that they're okay with it, but those school districts
                    sites seem to me to be a very good opportunity to build workforce housing for our teachers.

                    I think wherever the property is free, haha. That makes the numbers work really well. You know, it
                    was a while ago when the current superintendentfirst came on board, when I was a school board
                    member, that was one of the first things that I sat down to talk to him about is, how can we do
                    workforce housing for our school staff. It's not just the teachers, but all the school staff. There
                    are many models around the state now that Have different criteria of how they allow their school
                    staff to obtain the housing. Some of it is for a designated amount of time. Some of them help them
                    save save up money towards down payment, so their rent would go towards down payment money for them.
                    There's many, many, really amazing models that are happening all over the state and we need to take
                    advantage of the fact that the school district does own some property that could be potentially a
                    great spot to do. We did sit down and talk to a non-profit housing developer many years ago and just
                    did kind of a back-of-the-envelope look on how it would work and if the finances would be there and,
                    you know, it's a very doable thing when you own the property. So where would it go? I would choose
                    where the school district owns land. But we do have this housing element and if it was somewhere
                    that was identified in the housing element, I would hope that it fits in to wherever the plan is for
                    the entire city.

                    see the city council can and should play a relationship with these two elected bodies? And,

                    Strengthening the city and school partnership is one of my priorities. I have two school age
                    children. I drop them off and pick them up twice a day. And I myself work as a member of school side
                    council for Harvest Park. I work with school all the time. But in the meantime, the school and the
                    city are two different entities and they are governed by different boards. However, we are all in
                    the same city. There are many things that we can collaborate. I support a school resource officer
                    program. That is a great program to keep our schools and our campus safe and that is a city funded
                    program. That is just one of the many examples of how school can help our school. Regarding the
                    [Measure I], I do support a [Measure I]. As I said, as a parent of two school age children, I care
                    about our school facilities. I see the deteriorating conditions of our school facility. I see that a
                    bond measure is the only option to do a large-scale infrastructure upgrade. So I do support that.

                    Thanks for the question. So I think there are two different ways I look at this question. One is,
                    what is the official way that the city can, you know, work with our schools, and what are some of
                    the unofficial ways that the elected members of the city council can be support of our schools? So,
                    you know, as Joel said and as you all know, having Pleasanton have a strong partnership between the
                    city and our schools is fundamental to the success and the attractiveness of the city. So to that
                    end, some of the official ways that the city can work with our school district, you already see it
                    in the SROs. Its really important that the city continue to help fund that program. It's a program
                    that's supported by the vast majority of parents who are in our schools. And I think that is a good
                    example of the city and school district working as good partners together in an official capacity. I
                    mentioned workforce housing earlier, I think it would be amazing if we could get the city to work in
                    partnership with the school district, on making sure we can house our teachers who are in our
                    district. And when it comes to the school bond, [Measure I], I am supportive of it. You know, we
                    have many young families here in this city who have put their entire life savings in the down
                    payment of a home, have a mortgage with 1.5 to 2 million dollars for that home so that their kids
                    could come to the city and go to our schools. So I think it's important that those schools live up
                    to their reputation and continue to thrive with everything they need.

                    Thank you for the question. We all want the safe water. As a councilmember getting safe water is my
                    top priority. In Pleasanton, the water issue is a little bit complicated. We have aging wells and we
                    have the drought, and we needed to work with our partners and to deal with the PFAS issue. For this
                    complicated issue there is an engineering part; there is also a business part. Engineering part is,
                    this is a new issue. What technology we needed to choose? Buisness part is, does it make business
                    sense? As a PhD in engineering and worked on water treatment project on the electrical side before,
                    I believe what I'm well qualified to understand that the technical part. And as a leader who has
                    managed the multi-million dollar projects and the business, I believe I'm qualified to understand
                    the business part also. I agree with the current Council. We should pause. We need to pause and the
                    think what to do. And there are many things for us to think and I'm qualified to help the council to
                    decide the best option for our resident to get the safe water. Thank you.

                    Um, let's see where to begin. The school district and the board and the city council absolutely
                    needs to work together very closely and collaboratively. The two bodies are the community leaders
                    and I think that both bodies set the tone for the city and the school district about just how we
                    operate as a city and, you know, feeling our community pride and our community inclusion and just
                    it's really important that they work together. The bond is absolutely necessary if we want to
                    continue being a thriving community. Schools are a big part of our community. It also helps this
                    community maintain its real estate value and when you look at our neighboring cities, their schools
                    are new or newly remodeled and they look amazing, and we are losing our competitiveness. When you
                    look at our school facilities, if people are moving here and there, looking at Dublin or San Ramon
                    or Pleasanton are their choices, they're going to see the schools and those schools are in much,
                    much better and more, modern shape. Those communities have invested in their schools and Pleasanton
                    needs to step up and do the same. It is not great that our students and our teachers have to work in
                    subpar facilities. So supporting the bond is vitally important to the future of our community.

                    I'm the parent of three children who all attended and graduated from Pleasanton schools so this is a
                    matter of it's very near and dear to my heart and also for the benefit of all the other kids that I
                    see attending, the local school. Lydixin is just right down the street from me. I'm talking about
                    their futures. In speaking with members of the school board, current members, it's my understanding
                    that Pleasanton and the city have been working together and cooperatively very closely already, and
                    I see very good reasons for strengthening that partnership and cooperation. It seems to be
                    benefiting both parties and they're even greater benefits I can see from further collaboration and
                    partnering. For example, the gymnasiums at Harvest Park are jointly owned by the city and the school
                    district. That has proved to be very useful and very beneficial to all the users of those facilities
                    and ensures maximum use of those facilities for the benefit of all people. The traffic and road and
                    lighting improvements that were made outside of Foothill High School. That happened at the same time
                    as the revitalization of the front that are also benefit. So, and lastly I support Measure I. It
                    does increase property taxes, that's a concern. The school that was promised in 2016 needs to be
                    built this time.

                    Thank you for the question. So if this is a opinion that our business community is saying they're
                    experiencing, then I would first start by saying that I would trust their assessment of it. I do not
                    own or operate a business, so I would go to the business community to figure out if if that is the
                    case. If elected to the city council I would want to have a working and close partnership with the
                    chamber and with small business communities in my district and then downtown and the city to make
                    sure that I'm aprised about the challenges that are facing our small businesses. I do think that if
                    there are challenges when it comes to permitting and the processing of it and that's impacting the
                    ability for our businesses to thrive here I would want to, from the city council, direct staff
                    --direct the city manager to direct staff to look into it and come back to us with a report and come
                    up with solutions for how we can speed things up. I do think that with all the different ways the
                    city council is currently engaged in micromanaging businesses, I think I would rather steer away
                    from some of those more bureaucratic approaches to the job and steer towards how we can help small
                    businesses and if permitting and the time it takes to process as one of them I would want to address
                    those issues.

                    Thanks for this question. This is a really good one. I have had an earful from business business
                    owners and property owners around town about the difficulties in the permitting process in the city.
                    But on the other side of that, historically it was worse than it is now. Apparently what we have now
                    is the improved version, but I'm still hearing that it's a huge, huge challenge. When I first
                    decided to run for City Council people were saying to me: "Oh, are you going to do something about
                    all the vacancies down on Main Street?" And I said, well, the city council doesn't really
                    specifically have jurisdiction over that. But what is happening, is many of the vacancies, the
                    property owners, you know, have somebody who's interested in renting their their building and they
                    go to the city, they bring their plans, and they find out how incredibly onerous it is and how
                    expensive it is and how long it's going to take to get through, they decide to go elsewhere. So it
                    concerns me because it impacts our revenue to the city, it impacts the vibrancy of, and in case of
                    the main street, it's really difficult how we can streamline the permitting process a little bit
                    better and that the city needs to have maybe of a more can do attitude, instead of can't do

                    As an engineer and a current planning commissioner, my attitude is to let the facts and the figures
                    do the talking. I would always seek to understand the details and the concerns more clearly. So,
                    first step would be to sit down with the business owners to understand exactly what the concern
                    specifically are. The devil is in the details. So, there are, and I know there are some situations
                    that must be that they must be referring to so I want to know those. We work and we now have a
                    terrific new city manager, Jerry Boden. I'd like to have, once we identify those along with the city
                    manager and the other members of the council, to sit down and work with the business community and
                    to understand the point of view of the process. We have a standard process. If it doesn't work, it
                    needs to be fixed. If it can be made better, if there are synergies that can be achieved, by all
                    means we should do them. As a Planning Commissioner, I see the planning process from the point of
                    view of new developments. The permitting process is a little more outside the purview of the
                    Planning Commission, but I want city leaders to be able to work with businesses and understand their
                    concerns and sit down and make it better if it can't be made better.

                    Sure there can be talks that affect many, many, many different people. So I do, I am aware of some
                    feedbacks from our business and community regarding lengthy process for permitting and this process,
                    so I'm aware of that. When I'm in the city council, I will look into the details. So, I have already
                    heard from the business community and I will work with city staff and the managers to look into the
                    process, to understand more about the process and to work together to improve the process. I believe
                    that any process can be improved and I'm very pro-business. Our business represents 60% off the
                    revenue for our city, and they are very critical part of our community. I have the full support for
                    our business owners and small business owners, and and business people, so I pledge to look into
                    this issue and work-this better and find a better way to improve for the process.

                    Yes, the water issue is a very serious concern and city needs to prioritize our water situation. As
                    I've said before, you know, I'm not a water scientist or a water expert and I know that the city has
                    been directed to the staff to really make this a priority to work, to come up with different
                    recommendations that they can present to the city council. So I look forward to those
                    recommendations. But it is definitely something that we need to keep an eagle eye on and make sure
                    that we have enough water. Good healthy clean, drinking safe water that's chemical-free. But I do
                    think that our partnership with Zone 7 is vitally important. They are the Water Authority for us in
                    Pleasanton and historically that relationship hasn't always been very good, and I know that it's
                    better, but it needs to continue to be a very tight, close relationship because we need them to help
                    us with our water situation. So I am looking forward to the staff's recommendations.

                    The water that flows into our homes must always be safe to drink. 80% of Pleasanton's water is
                    supplied by Zone 7 Water Agency. The other 20% comes from Pleasanton's wells. Both of these sources
                    are threatened with contamination by forever chemicals, called PFAS, which through decades of use
                    have now reached the valley's groundwater. These chemicals pose a threat to our health because they
                    build up in our bodies over time. They'll continue to spread in the ground water. Pleasanton has
                    already shut down One of its main Wheels because of this contamination and the other two are
                    threatened. If we're to continue drinking the city's water and make sure the system can operate the
                    way it should, then action is needed to treat and remove these substances from the water. As an
                    alternative the city is exploring the purchase of water from Zone 7 to replace 20% that comes from
                    our wells. So our cooperation with Zone Seven is essential. Either solution is going to end up being
                    costly and will entail some uncertainty. But action is critical to ensure that the water we drink
                    remain safe. The next city council is going to have some major decisions to make, and I am help make
                    those decisions. The solutions that have been proposed include water treatments and well
                    rehabilitation. For Pleasanton to go into the water treatment business, long term that may be what
                    is required and if that's what's required for safe drinking water for everyone, then I'm for it.

                    We all want to save clean drinking water and as a city council member I will make sure that the

                    drinking water is one of my top priorities. And in Pleasanton, water is a pretty complicated issue.
                    We have aging wells and we also need to work with our Partner Zone 7, and we also need to deal with
                    PFAS issue. The current city council developed a plan on filtering and on renovating our aging water
                    wells with the new regulation and some emerging cover standard on PFAS and we decided to pass on
                    that, and there will be tough decisions for us to make and that's pretty challenging both
                    technically and commercially. I have a PhD in engineering and I do have the experience on water
                    treatment plan from electrical engineering site and I also managed a multimillion-dollar business. I

                    So during this campaign I've come to see this question as the most important and complicated
                    question to answer, but it's very important because we have to figure out how we maintain having a
                    safe and reliable and sustainable source of water for our city and its residents. That question is
                    now becoming much more challenging as we have a shortage of water and as we're entering a new stage
                    of climate change. So, and figuring out how to come to solutions. I think there are a couple of
                    things. First, I want to say that we need to be a better regional partner as a city to our water
                    agencies, both this Zone 7 and DSRSD. I think there have been recent decisions and made by the
                    current Council where that those partnerships were not respected and were not valued as much as they
                    should be. We're not in the driver's seat when it comes to those relationships. If I'm elected to
                    the city council, I will advocate as well as I can for the city, but it also requires being
                    collaborative partner with those agencies so that we can get the best outcome for our city, not just
                    dictating what we want. When it comes to solutions, I'm supportive of the city taking the stance to
                    kind of put a pause on things. I want to look at treatment, blending, new water sources. And the
                    last thing I'll add is I know that the chamber came out in support of building a treatment plant. I
                    also spoken to people in Zone 7 who don't think it's a good idea for Pleasanton to get in the water
                    treatment business. I honestly don't know what my answer is, but I'm looking forward to continue to
                    look into the issue.

                    Thank you for that question. The question has to do with accountability for our police officers,
                    police department. The feedback in the latest community survey last August, the performance of our
                    Pleasanton Police Department, was overwhelmingly positive. There are improvements that the city
                    police department has made as evidenced in their recent semi-annual report at the last City Council
                    meeting. There are good things to come out of that report, concerns around how the Pleasanton Police
                    Department deals with mental health situations, in particular with school, resource officers, is
                    quite encouraging. The information on the new pilot program for alternate response unit with mental
                    health experts, assisting in those types of calls or taking the lead. Those are all steps in the
                    right direction. As far as an oversight commission. No, I don't support an oversight commission. In
                    fact, you know it's been said, if it's not broke, don't fix it. I'll reserve judgment on to whether
                    it's broken or not. I need to learn a lot more. It may be that an auditor might be a possible
                    solution, but to say that, I need more evidence would be
                    insensitive to those who have suffered tragic consequences.

                    Thanks for the question. Public safety is my top priority. I do not see the need of an oversight
                    committee or commission. I believe our city council is elected by our citizens and that they
                    represent our city and they provide proper oversight for the police department through the City
                    Manager, and actually I believe the police department reports to the city council twice a year, so
                    we already have sufficient oversight from the city council so I do not see the need for another
                    oversight committee or commission. On top of that, all of our officers are professionals. They are
                    following policies and procedures. The city council has a place. I do not see the need for having an
                    oversight committee.

                    Thank you for the question. Like has been previously said, like the vast majority of residents in
                    Pleasanton, I believe that our Police Department is doing an excellent job. I am also very proud to
                    have earned the endorsement of our Police Officers Association. I strongly support preserving public
                    funding for public safety, and I also believe that the police department is currently in very
                    capable hands. I've watched the most recent, I was in the city council chambers for the most recent
                    report from Chief Wwing. I've watched past reports. I think those are always very thorough, and very
                    transparent, and watching him and his staff give those reports, it's just very clear that our cities
                    and capable hands and that our police department is, you know, engaged in addressing and reforming
                    things that need to be reformed, and I think they're doing a very good job at that. And I believe
                    with your primary question when it comes to whether or not we need to spend more money on oversight
                    or reporting the question is you have to first ask yourself is there any evidence that those things
                    are needed? And frankly, I do not see that evidence right now. I do support providing our officers
                    with all the training and equipment that they need. And I do support providing appropriate responses
                    for people experiencing mental health crisis. But, as I said I, think our city police department is
                    doing an excellent job at that and they already do many of the things reformers are asking for in
                    other cities.

                    Thanks, you should know better than James. That no question is simple here. So for about nine years
                    in my role at Alameda County, I got to work, shoulder-to-shoulder, with law enforcement agencies and
                    I have a very, very good understanding of what their role is and what their role isn't. And I
                    believe that our police department does a very good job. The whole 12 years that I was on the school
                    board, we never had one issue or complaint that came forward about the SROs. So very happy about
                    that. I'm glad that the chief has that Chief Advisory Group. I think that, that serves, you know, a
                    certain purpose. But along with the others, I don't think that an oversight committee is really
                    necessary right now because things are going well. We do have the two-year reports that come to the
                    City Council. They seem very open transparent, you know, and happy to collaborate, so I just don't
                    really see a need for it. If that ever changed, I think that would be a good idea. We do have one
                    council member who really would like to have that and would like to spend a lot of money on an
                    outside consulting firm and have this oversight committee and I just really don't think it's
                    necessary at this time.

                    As City Council Members financial stewardship is an extremely important part of your job. With the stock market decline, CalPERs losses may impact pension contributions by drawing critical financial resources away from other city services and priorities. Lackluster return will mean California towns, counties, and school districts will face higher annua pension contributions during the 24-25 fiscal year. So how does this impact Pleasanton? And then, sort of more broadly, you know, how is this going to affect these City's budgeting and finance and where can the city improve this financing?

                    Nonprofit organizations are an important part of our business community. It's often the case that local business and community leaders are involved with nonprofits as a way to give back as an extension of their own desire to get involved. Please, share with us which nonprofit group you're in, your role in the group, and the reasons you connected with them.
